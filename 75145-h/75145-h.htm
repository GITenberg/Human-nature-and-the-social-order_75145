</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Are Aspects of the Same Thing—The Fallacy of Setting
them in Opposition—Various Forms of this Fallacy.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>“Society and the Individual” is really the subject
of this whole book, and not merely of Chapter One.
It is my general aim to set forth, from various points
of view, what the individual is, considered as a member
of a social whole; while the special purpose of
this chapter is only to offer a preliminary statement
of the matter, as I conceive it, afterward to be unfolded
at some length and variously illustrated.</p>

<p class='c012'>A separate individual is an abstraction unknown
to experience, and so likewise is society when regarded
as something apart from individuals. The
real thing is Human Life, which may be considered
either in an individual aspect or in a social, that is
to say a general, aspect; but is always, as a matter
of fact, both individual and general. In other words,
“society” and “individuals” do not denote separable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>phenomena, but are simply collective and distributive
aspects of the same thing, the relation between
them being like that between other expressions
one of which denotes a group as a whole and the
other the members of the group, such as the army
and the soldiers, the class and the students, and so
on. This holds true of any social aggregate, great
or small; of a family, a city, a nation, a race; of
mankind as a whole: no matter how extensive, complex,
or enduring a group may be, no good reason can
be given for regarding it as essentially different in
this respect from the smallest, simplest, or most
transient.</p>

<p class='c012'>So far, then, as there is any difference between the
two, it is rather in our point of view than in the object
we are looking at: when we speak of society, or
use any other collective term, we fix our minds upon
some general view of the people concerned, while
when we speak of individuals we disregard the general
aspect and think of them as if they were separate.
Thus “the Cabinet” may consist of President Lincoln,
Secretary Stanton, Secretary Seward, and so
on; but when I say “the Cabinet” I do not suggest
the same idea as when I enumerate these gentlemen
separately. Society, or any complex group, may, to
ordinary observation, be a very different thing from
all of its members viewed one by one—as a man who
beheld General Grant’s army from Missionary Ridge
would have seen something other than he would by
approaching every soldier in it. In the same way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>a picture is made up of so many square inches of
painted canvas; but if you should look at these one
at a time, covering the others, until you had seen
them all, you would still not have seen the picture.
There may, in all such cases, be a system or
organization in the whole that is not apparent in the
parts. In this sense, and in no other, is there a difference
between society and the individuals of which
it is composed; a difference not residing in the facts
themselves but existing to the observer on account of
the limits of his perception. A <em>complete</em> view of society
would also be a complete view of all the individuals,
and <em>vice versa</em>; there would be no difference
between them.</p>

<p class='c012'>And just as there is no society or group that is not
a collective view of persons, so there is no individual
who may not be regarded as a particular view
of social groups. He has no separate existence;
through both the hereditary and the social factors in
his life a man is bound into the whole of which he
is a member, and to consider him apart from it is
quite as artificial as to consider society apart from
individuals.</p>

<p class='c011'>If this is true there is, of course, a fallacy in that
not uncommon manner of speaking which sets the
social and the individual over against each other as
separate and antagonistic. The word “social” appears
to be used in at least three fairly distinct
senses, but in none of these does it mean something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>that can properly be regarded as opposite to individual
or personal.</p>

<p class='c012'>In its largest sense it denotes that which pertains
to the collective aspect of humanity, to society in its
widest and vaguest meaning. In this sense the individual
and all his attributes are social, since they
are all connected with the general life in one way or
another, and are part of a collective development.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again, social may mean what pertains to immediate
intercourse, to the life of conversation and face-to-face
sympathy—sociable in short. This is something
quite different, but no more antithetical to
individual than the other; it is in these relations that
individuality most obviously exists and expresses
itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a third sense the word means conducive to the
collective welfare, and thus becomes nearly equivalent
to moral, as when we say that crime or sensuality is
unsocial or anti-social; but here again it cannot properly
be made the antithesis of individual—since wrong
is surely no more individual than right—but must be
contrasted with immoral, brutal, selfish, or some
other word with an ethical implication.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are a number of expressions which are closely
associated in common usage with this objectionable
antithesis; such words, for instance, as individualism,
socialism, particularism, collectivism.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
These appear to be used with a good deal of vagueness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>so that it is always in order to require that anyone
who employs them shall make it plain in what
sense they are to be taken. I wish to make no captious
objections to particular forms of expression, and
so far as these can be shown to have meanings that
express the facts of life I have nothing to say against
them. Of the current use of individualism and socialism
in antithesis to each other, about the same
may be said as of the words without the <em>ism</em>. I do
not see that life presents two distinct and opposing
tendencies that can properly be called individualism
and socialism, any more than that there are two distinct
and opposing entities, society and the individual,
to embody these tendencies. The phenomena usually
called individualistic are always socialistic in the
sense that they are expressive of tendencies growing
out of the general life, and, contrariwise, the so-called
socialistic phenomena have always an obvious individual
aspect. These and similar terms may be used,
conveniently enough, to describe theories or programmes
of the day, but whether they are suitable for
purposes of careful study appears somewhat doubtful.
If used, they ought, it seems to me, to receive more
adequate definition than they have at present.</p>

<p class='c012'>For example, all the principal epochs of European
history might be, and most of them are, spoken of as
individualistic on one ground or another, and without
departing from current usage of the word. The decaying
Roman Empire was individualistic if a decline
of public spirit and an every-man-for-himself feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>and practice constitute individualism. So also was
the following period of political confusion. The
feudal system is often regarded as individualistic, because
of the relative independence and isolation of
small political units—quite a different use of the
word from the preceding—and after this come the
Revival of Learning, the Renaissance, and the Reformation,
which are all commonly spoken of, on still
other grounds, as assertions of individualism. Then
we reach the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
sceptical, transitional, and, again, individualistic;
and so to our own time, which many hold to be the
most individualistic of all. One feels like asking
whether a word which means so many things as this
means anything whatever.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is always some confusion of terms in speaking
of opposition between an individual and society
in general, even when the writer’s meaning is obvious
enough: it would be more accurate to say either that
one individual is opposing many, or that one part of
society is opposing other parts; and thus avoid confusing
the two aspects of life in the same expression.
When Emerson says that society is in a conspiracy
against the independence of each of its members, we
are to understand that any peculiar tendency represented
by one person finds itself more or less at variance
with the general current of tendencies organized
in other persons. It is no more individual, nor any
less social, in a large sense, than other tendencies
represented by more persons. A thousand persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>are just as truly individuals as one, and the man who
seems to stand alone draws his being from the general
stream of life just as truly and inevitably as if he
were one of a thousand. Innovation is just as social
as conformity, genius as mediocrity. These distinctions
are not between what is individual and what is
social, but between what is usual or established and
what is exceptional or novel. In other words, wherever
you find life as society there you will find life as
individuality, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>I think, then, that the antithesis, society <em>versus</em> the
individual, is false and hollow whenever used as a
general or philosophical statement of human relations.
Whatever idea may be in the minds of those
who set these words and their derivatives over against
each other, the notion conveyed is that of two separable
entities or forces; and certainly such a notion
is untrue to fact.</p>

<p class='c012'>Most people not only think of individuals and society
as more or less separate and antithetical, but
they look upon the former as antecedent to the latter.
That persons make society would be generally
admitted as a matter of course; but that society
makes persons would strike many as a startling notion,
though I know of no good reason for looking
upon the distributive aspect of life as more primary
or causative than the collective aspect. The reason
for the common impression appears to be that we
think most naturally and easily of the individual
phase of life, simply because it is a tangible one, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>phase under which men appear to the senses, while
the actuality of groups, of nations, of mankind at
large, is realized only by the active and instructed
imagination. We ordinarily regard society, so far as
we conceive it at all, in a vaguely material aspect, as
an aggregate of physical bodies, not as the vital whole
which it is; and so, of course, we do not see that it
may be as original or causative as anything else.
Indeed many look upon “society” and other general
terms as somewhat mystical, and are inclined to
doubt whether there is any reality back of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>This naïve individualism of thought—which, however,
does not truly see the individual any more than
it does society—is reinforced by traditions in which
all of us are brought up, and is so hard to shake off
that it may be worth while to point out a little more
definitely some of the prevalent ways of conceiving
life which are permeated by it, and which anyone
who agrees with what has just been said may regard
as fallacious. My purpose in doing this is only to
make clearer the standpoint from which succeeding
chapters are written, and I do not propose any
thorough discussion of the views mentioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>First, then, we have <em>mere individualism</em>. In this
the distributive aspect is almost exclusively regarded,
collective phases being looked upon as quite
secondary and incidental. Each person is held to
be a separate agent, and all social phenomena are
thought of as originating in the action of such agents.
The individual is the source, the independent, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>only human source, of events. Although this way of
looking at things has been much discredited by the
evolutionary science and philosophy of recent years,
it is by no means abandoned, even in theory, and
practically it enters as a premise, in one shape or
another, into most of the current thought of the day.
It springs naturally from the established way of
thinking, congenial, as I have remarked, to the ordinary
material view of things and corroborated by
theological and other traditions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next is <em>double causation</em>, or a partition of power
between society and the individual, thought of as
separate causes. This notion, in one shape or another,
is the one ordinarily met with in social and
ethical discussion. It is no advance, philosophically,
upon the preceding. There is the same premise
of the individual as a separate, unrelated agent;
but over against him is set a vaguely conceived general
or collective interest and force. It seems that
people are so accustomed to thinking of themselves
as uncaused causes, special creators on a small scale,
that when the existence of general phenomena is forced
upon their notice they are likely to regard these as
something additional, separate, and more or less antithetical.
Our two forces contend with varying fortunes,
the thinker sometimes sympathizing with one,
sometimes with the other, and being an individualist
or a socialist accordingly. The doctrines usually understood
in connection with these terms differ, as regards
their conception of the nature of life, only in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>taking opposite sides of the same questionable antithesis.
The socialist holds it desirable that the
general or collective force should win; the individualist
has a contrary opinion. Neither offers any
change of ground, any reconciling and renewing
breadth of view. So far as breadth of view is concerned
a man might quite as well be an individualist
as a socialist or collectivist, the two being identical
in philosophy though antagonistic in programme. If
one is inclined to neither party he may take refuge in
the expectation that the controversy, resting, as he
may hold that it does, on a false conception of life,
will presently take its proper place among the forgotten
<em>débris</em> of speculation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thirdly we have <em>primitive individualism</em>. This
expression has been used to describe the view that
sociality follows individuality in time, is a later and
additional product of development. This view is a
variety of the preceding, and is, perhaps, formed by
a mingling of individualistic preconceptions with
a somewhat crude evolutionary philosophy. Individuality
is usually conceived as lower in moral rank
as well as precedent in time. Man <em>was</em> a mere individual,
mankind a mere aggregation of such, but he
has gradually become socialized, he is progressively
merging into a social whole. Morally speaking, the
individual is the bad, the social the good, and we
must push on the work of putting down the former
and bringing in the latter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course the view which I regard as sound, is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>individuality is neither prior in time nor lower in
moral rank than sociality; but that the two have always
existed side by side as complementary aspects of
the same thing, and that the line of progress is from a
lower to a higher type of both, not from the one to the
other. If the word social is applied only to the higher
forms of mental life it should, as already suggested, be
opposed not to individual, but to animal, sensual, or
some other word implying mental or moral inferiority.
If we go back to a time when the state of our
remote ancestors was such that we are not willing to
call it social, then it must have been equally undeserving
to be described as individual or personal;
that is to say, they must have been just as inferior to
us when viewed separately as when viewed collectively.
To question this is to question the vital
unity of human life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The life of the human species, like that of other
species, must always have been both general and particular,
must always have had its collective and distributive
aspects. The plane of this life has gradually
risen, involving, of course, both the aspects
mentioned. Now, as ever, they develop as one, and
may be observed united in the highest activities of
the highest minds. Shakespeare, for instance, is in
one point of view a unique and transcendent individual;
in another he is a splendid expression of the
general life of mankind: the difference is not in him
but in the way we choose to look at him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally, there is <em>the social faculty view</em>. This expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>might be used to indicate those conceptions
which regard the social as including only a part,
often a rather definite part, of the individual. Human
nature is thus divided into individualistic or
non-social tendencies or faculties, and those that are
social. Thus, certain emotions, as love, are social;
others, as fear or anger, are unsocial or individualistic.
Some writers have even treated the intelligence
as an individualistic faculty, and have found sociality
only in some sorts of emotion or sentiment.</p>

<p class='c012'>This idea of instincts or faculties that are peculiarly
social is well enough if we use this word in the
sense of pertaining to conversation or immediate fellow-feeling.
Affection is certainly more social in
this sense than fear. But if it is meant that these
instincts or faculties are in themselves morally higher
than others, or that they alone pertain to the collective
life, the view is, I think, very questionable. At
any rate the opinion I hold, and expect to explain
more fully in the further course of this book, is that
man’s psychical outfit is not divisible into the social
and the non-social; but that he is all social in a
large sense, is all a part of the common human life,
and that his social or moral progress consists less in
the aggrandizement of particular faculties or instincts
and the suppression of others, than in the discipline
of all with reference to a progressive organization
of life which we know in thought as conscience.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some instincts or tendencies may grow in relative
importance, may have an increasing function, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the opposite may be true of others. Such relative
growth and diminution of parts seems to be a general
feature of evolution, and there is no reason why it
should be absent from our mental development. But
here as well as elsewhere most parts, if not all, are
or have been functional with reference to a life collective
as well as distributive; there is no sharp
separation of faculties, and progress takes place
rather by gradual adaptation of old organs to new
functions than by disuse and decay.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c009'>SUGGESTION AND CHOICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Meaning of these Terms and their Relation to each
Other—Individual and Social Aspects of Will or Choice—Suggestion
and Choice in Children—The Scope of
Suggestion commonly Underestimated—Practical Limitations
upon Deliberate Choice—Illustrations of the Action
of the <em>Milieu</em>—The Greater or Less Activity of
Choice Reflects the State of Society—Suggestibility.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>The antithesis between suggestion and choice is
another of those familiar ideas which are not always
so clear as they should be.</p>

<p class='c012'>The word suggestion is used here to denote an influence
that works in a comparatively mechanical or
reflex way, without calling out that higher selective
activity of the mind implied in choice or will. Thus
the hypnotic subject who performs apparently meaningless
actions at the word of the operator is said
to be controlled by suggestion; so also is one who
catches up tricks of speech and action from other
people without meaning to. From such instances
the idea is extended to embrace any thought or action
which is mentally simple and seems not to involve
choice. The behavior of people under strong
emotion is suggestive; crowds are suggestible; habit
is a kind of suggestion, and so on.</p>

<p class='c012'>I prefer this word to imitation, which some use in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>this or a similar sense, because the latter, as ordinarily
understood, seems to cover too little in some directions
and too much in others. In common use it
means an action that results in visible or audible resemblance.
Now although our simple reactions to
the influence of others are largely of this sort, they
are by no means altogether so; the actions of a child
during the first six months of life, for instance, are
very little imitative in this sense; on the other hand,
the imitation that produces a visible resemblance
may be a voluntary process of the most complex sort
imaginable, like the skilful painting of a portrait.
However, it makes little difference what words we
use if we have sound meanings back of them, and I
am far from intending to find fault with writers, like
Professor Baldwin and M. Tarde, who adopt the
word and give it a wide and unusual application.
For my purpose, however, it does not seem expedient
to depart so far from ordinary usage.</p>

<p class='c012'>The distinction between suggestion and choice is
not, I think, a sharp opposition between separable
or radically different things, but rather a way
of indicating the lower and higher stages of a
series. What we call choice or will appears to be an
ill-defined area of more strenuous mental activity
within a much wider field of activity similar in kind
but less intense. It is not sharply divisible from the
mass of involuntary thought. The truth is that the
facts of the mind, of society, indeed of any living
whole, seldom admit of sharp division, but show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>gradual transitions from one thing to another: there
are no fences in these regions. We speak of suggestion
as mechanical; but it seems probable that all
psychical life is selective, or, in some sense, choosing,
and that the rudiments of consciousness and will
may be discerned or inferred in the simplest reaction
of the lowest living creature. In our own minds the
comparatively simple ideas which are called suggestions
are by no means single and primary, but each
one is itself a living, shifting, multifarious bit of life,
a portion of the fluid “stream of thought” formed
by some sort of selection and synthesis out of simpler
elements. On the other hand, our most elaborate
and volitional thought and action is suggested
in the sense that it consists not in creation out of
nothing, but in a creative synthesis or reorganization
of old material.</p>

<p class='c012'>The distinction, then, is one of degree rather than
of kind; and choice, as contrasted with suggestion,
is, in its individual aspect, <em>a comparatively elaborate
process of mental organization or synthesis</em>, of which
we are reflectively aware, and which is rendered
necessary by complexity in the elements of our
thought. In its social aspect—for all, or nearly all,
our choices relate in one way or another to the social
environment—it is <em>an organization of comparatively
complex social relations</em>. Precisely as the conditions
about us and the ideas suggested by those conditions
become intricate, are we forced to think, to choose, to
define the useful and the right, and, in general, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>work out the higher intellectual life. When life is
simple, thought and action are comparatively mechanical
or suggestive; the higher consciousness is
not aroused, the reflective will has little or nothing
to do; the captain stays below and the inferior officers
work the ship. But when life is diverse,
thought is so likewise, and the mind must achieve
the higher synthesis, or suffer that sense of division
which is its peculiar pain. In short, the question of
suggestion and choice is only another view of the
question of uniformity and complexity in social relations.</p>

<p class='c012'>Will, or choice, like all phases of mental life, may
be looked at either in a particular or a general aspect;
and we have, accordingly, individual will or
social will, depending upon our point of view, as to
whether we regard the activity singly or in a mass.
But there is no real separation; they are only different
phases of the same thing. Any choice that I can
make is a synthesis of suggestions derived in one
way or another from the general life; and it also reacts
upon that life, so that my will is social as being
both effect and cause with reference to it. If I buy a
straw hat you may look at my action separately, as
my individual choice, or as part of a social demand
for straw hats, or as indicating non-conformity to a
fashion of wearing some other sort of hats, and so
on. There is no mystery about the matter; nothing
that need puzzle anyone who is capable of perceiving
that a thing may look differently from different standpoints,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>like the post that was painted a different
color on each of its four sides.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is, I think, a mistake of superficial readers to
imagine that psychologists or sociologists are trying
to depreciate the will, or that there is any tendency
to such depreciation in a sound evolutionary science
or philosophy. The trouble with the popular view
of will, derived chiefly from tradition, is not that it
exaggerates its importance, which would perhaps be
impossible; but, first, that it thinks of will only in
the individual aspect, and does not grasp the fact—plain
enough it would seem—that the act of choice is
cause and effect in a general life; and, second, that
it commonly overlooks the importance of involuntary
forces, or at least makes them separate from and antithetical
to choice—as if the captain were expected
to work the ship all alone, or in opposition to the
crew, instead of using them as subordinate agents.
There is little use in arguing abstractly points like
these; but if the reader who may be puzzled by them
will try to free himself from metaphysical formulæ,
and determine to <em>see</em> the facts as they are, he will be
in a way to get some healthy understanding of the
matter.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>By way of illustrating these general statements I
shall first offer a few remarks concerning suggestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and choice in the life of children, and then go on to
discuss their working in adult life and upon the
career as a whole.</p>

<p class='c011'>There appears to be quite a general impression
that children are far more subject to control through
suggestion or mechanical imitation than grown-up
people are; in other words, that their volition is less
active. I am not at all sure that this is the case:
their choices are, as a rule, less stable and consistent
than ours, their minds have less definiteness of organization,
so that their actions appear less rational
and more externally determined; but on the other
hand they have less of the mechanical subjection to
habit that goes with a settled character. Choice is a
process of growth, of progressive mental organization
through selection and assimilation of the materials
which life presents, and this process is surely never
more vigorous than in childhood and youth. It can
hardly be doubted that the choosing and formative
vigor of the mind is greater under the age of twenty-five
than after: the will of middle age is stronger in
the sense that it has more momentum, but it has less
acceleration, runs more on habit, and so is less capable
of fresh choice.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am distrustful of that plausible but possibly illusive
analogy between the mind of the child and the
mind of primitive man, which, in this connection,
would suggest a like simplicity and inertness of
thought in the two. Our children achieve in a dozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>years a mental development much above that of
savages, and supposing that they do, in some sense,
recapitulate the progress of the race, they certainly
cover the ground at a very different rate of speed,
which involves a corresponding intensity of mental
life. After the first year certainly, if not from birth,
they share our social order, and we induct them so
rapidly into its complex life that their minds have
perhaps as much novelty and diversity to synthetize
as ours do.</p>

<p class='c012'>Certainly one who begins to observe children with
a vague notion that their actions, after the first few
months, are almost all mechanically imitative, is
likely to be surprised. I had this notion, derived,
perhaps without much warrant, from a slight acquaintance
with writings on child-study current previous
to 1893, when my first child was born. He
was a boy—I will call him R.—in whom imitativeness,
as ordinarily understood, happened to be unusually
late in its development. Until he was more than two
years and a half old all that I noticed that was obviously
imitative, in the sense of a visible or audible
repetition of the acts of others, was the utterance of
about six words that he learned to say during his
second year. It is likely that very close observation,
assisted by the clearer notion of what to look for that
comes by experience, would have discovered more:
but no more was obvious to ordinary expectant attention.
The obvious thing was his constant use of
experiment and reflection, and the slow and often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>curious results that he attained in this manner. At
two and a half he had learned, for instance, to use a
fork quite skilfully. The wish to use it was perhaps
an imitative impulse, in a sense, but his methods
were original and the outcome of a long course of independent
and reflective experiment. His skill was
the continuation of a dexterity previously acquired in
playing with long pins, which he ran into cushions,
the interstices of his carriage, etc. The fork was
apparently conceived as an interesting variation upon
the hat-pin, and not, primarily, as a means of getting
food or doing what others did. In creeping or walking,
at which he was very slow, partly on account of
a lame foot, he went through a similar series of devious
experiments, which apparently had no reference
to what he saw others do.</p>

<p class='c012'>He did not begin to talk—beyond using the few
words already mentioned—until over two years and
eight months old; having previously refused to interest
himself in it, although he understood others
as well, apparently, as any child of his age. He
preferred to make his wants known by grunts and
signs; and instead of delighting in imitation he
evidently liked better a kind of activity that was
only indirectly connected with the suggestions of
others.</p>

<p class='c012'>I frequently tried to produce imitation, but almost
wholly without success. For example, when
he was striving to accomplish something with his
blocks I would intervene and show him, by example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>how, as I thought, it might be done, but these
suggestions were invariably, so far as I remember
or have recorded, received with indifference or protest.
He liked to puzzle it out quietly for himself,
and to be shown how to do a thing often seemed
to destroy his interest in it. Yet he would profit by
observation of others in his own fashion, and I sometimes
detected him making use of ideas to which he
seemed to pay no attention when they were first presented.
In short, he showed that aversion, which
minds of a pondering, constructive turn perhaps always
show, to anything which suddenly and crudely
broke in upon his system of thought. At the same
time that he was so backward in the ordinary curriculum
of childhood, he showed in other ways, which
it is perhaps unnecessary to describe, that comparison
and reflection were well developed. This preoccupation
with private experiment and reflection, and reluctance
to learn from others, were undoubtedly a
cause of his slow development, particularly in speech,
his natural aptitude for which appeared in a good
enunciation and a marked volubility as soon as he
really began to talk.</p>

<p class='c012'>Imitation came all at once: he seemed to perceive
quite suddenly that this was a short cut to many
things, and took it up, not in a merely mechanical or
suggestive way, but consciously, intelligently, as a
means to an end. The imitative act, however, was
often an end in itself, an interesting exercise of his
constructive faculties, pursued at first without much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>regard to anything beyond. This was the case with
the utterance of words, and, later, with spelling, with
each of which he became fascinated for its own sake
and regardless of its use as a means of communication.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a second child, M., a girl, I was able to observe
the working of a mind of a different sort, and of a
much more common type as regards imitation. When
two months and seven days old she was observed to
make sounds in reply to her mother when coaxed
with a certain pitch and inflection of voice. These
sounds were clearly imitative, since they were seldom
made at other times, but not mechanically so. They
were produced with every appearance of mental effort
and of delight in its success. Only vocal imitations,
of this rudimentary sort, were observed until eight
months was nearly reached, when the first manual
imitation, striking a button-hook upon the back of
a chair, was noticed. This action had been performed
experimentally before, and the imitation was
merely a repetition suggested by seeing her mother
do it, or perhaps by hearing the sound. After
this the development of imitative activity proceeded
much in the usual way, which has often been described.</p>

<p class='c012'>In both of these cases I was a good deal impressed
with the idea that the life of children, as compared
with that of adults, is less determined in a merely suggestive
way, and involves more will and choice, than
is commonly supposed. Imitation, in the sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>visible or audible repetition, was not so omnipresent
as I had expected, and when present seemed to be
in great part rational and voluntary rather than
mechanical. It is very natural to assume that to
do what someone else does requires no mental effort;
but this, as applied to little children, is, of
course, a great mistake. They cannot imitate an
act except by learning how to do it, any more than
grown-up people can, and for a child to learn a word
may be as complicated a process as for an older person
to learn a difficult piece on the piano. A novel
imitation is not at all mechanical, but a strenuous
voluntary activity, accompanied by effort and followed
by pleasure in success. All sympathetic observers
of children must be impressed, I imagine, by
the evident mental stress and concentration which
often accompanies their endeavors, whether imitative
or not, and is followed, as in adults, by the appearance
of relief when the action has come off successfully.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The “imitative instinct” is sometimes spoken of
as if it were a mysterious something that enabled the
child to perform involuntarily and without preparation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>acts that are quite new to him. It will be found
difficult, if one reflects upon the matter, to conceive
what could be the nature of an instinct or hereditary
tendency, not to do a definite thing previously performed
by our ancestors—as is the case with ordinary
instinct—but to do <em>anything</em>, within vague limits,
which happened to be done within our sight
or hearing. This doing of new things without definite
preparation, <em>either in heredity or experience</em>,
would seem to involve something like special creation
in the mental and nervous organism: and the
imitation of children has no such character. It is
quite evidently an acquired power, and if the act
imitated is at all complex the learning process involves
a good deal of thought and will. If there
is an imitative instinct it must, apparently, be something
in the way of a taste for repetition, which
stimulates the learning process without, however,
having any tendency to dispense with it. The taste
for repetition seems, in fact, to exist, at least in
most children, but even this may be sufficiently explained
as a phase of the general mental tendency
to act upon uncontradicted ideas. It is a doctrine
now generally taught by psychologists that the idea
of an action is itself a motive to that action, and
tends intrinsically to produce it unless something
intervenes to prevent. This being the case, it would
appear that we must always have some impulse to do
what we see done, provided it is something we understand
sufficiently to be able to form a definite idea of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>doing it.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> I am inclined to the view that it is unnecessary
to assume, in man, a special imitative instinct,
but that “as Preyer and others have shown in the
case of young children, mimicry arises mainly from
pleasure in activity as such, and not from its peculiar
quality as imitation.”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> An intelligent child imitates
because he has faculties crying for employment, and
imitation is a key that lets them loose: he needs to
do things and imitation gives him things to do. An
indication that sensible resemblance to the acts of
others is not the main thing sought is seen in such
cases as the following: M. had a trick of raising
her hands above her head, which she would perform,
when in the mood for it, either imitatively, when
someone else did it, or in response to the words
“How big is M.?” but she responded more readily
in the second or non-imitative way than in the other.
This example well illustrates the reason for my preference
of the word suggestion over imitation to describe
these simple reactions. In this case the action
performed had no sort of resemblance to the form of
words “How big is M.?” that started it, and could
be called imitative only in a recondite sense. All that
is necessary is that there should be a suggestion, that
something should be presented that is connected in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the child’s mind with the action to be produced.
Whether this connection is by sensible resemblance
or not seems immaterial.</p>

<p class='c012'>There seems to be some opposition between imitation
of the visible, external kind, and reflection.
Children of one sort are attracted by sensible resemblance
and so are early and conspicuously imitative.
If this is kept up in a mechanical way after
the acts are well learned, and at the expense
of new efforts, it would seem to be a sign of mental
apathy, or even defect, as in the silly mimicry
of some idiots. Those of another sort are preoccupied
by the subtler combinations of thought which
do not, as a rule, lead to obvious imitation. Such
children are likely to be backward in the development
of active faculties, and slow to observe except
where their minds are specially interested. They
are also, if I may judge by R., slow to interpret features
and tones of voice, guileless and unaffected,
just because of this lack of keen personal perceptions,
and not quickly sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c012'>Accordingly, it is not at all clear that children
are, on the whole, any more given to imitation of
the mechanical sort, any more suggestible, than
adults. They appear so to us chiefly, perhaps, for
two reasons. In the first place, we fail to realize the
thought, the will, the effort, they expend upon their
imitations. They do things that have become mechanical
to us, and we assume that they are mechanical
to them, though closer observation and reflection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>would show us the contrary. These actions are
largely daring experiments, strenuous syntheses of
previously acquired knowledge, comparable in quality
to our own most earnest efforts, and not to the
thoughtless routine of our lives. We do not see that
their echoing of the words they hear is often not a
silly repetition, but a difficult and instructive exercise
of the vocal apparatus. Children imitate much
because they are growing much, and imitation is a
principal means of growth. This is true at any age;
the more alive and progressive a man is the more
actively he is admiring and profiting by his chosen
models.</p>

<p class='c012'>A second reason is that adults imitate at longer
range, as it were, so that the imitative character of
their acts is not so obvious. They come into contact
with more sorts of persons, largely unknown to one
another, and have access to a greater variety of suggestions
in books. Accordingly they present a deceitful
appearance of independence simply because
we do not see their models.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though we may be likely to exaggerate the difference
between children and adults as regards the sway
of suggestive influences, there is little danger of our
overestimating the importance of these in the life of
mankind at large. The common impression among
those who have given no special study to the matter
appears to be that suggestion has little part in the
mature life of a rational being; and though the control
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of involuntary impulses is recognized in tricks
of speech and manner, in fads, fashions, and the like,
it is not perceived to touch the more important points
of conduct. The fact, however, is that the main current
of our thought is made up of impulses absorbed
without deliberate choice from the life about us, or
else arising from hereditary instinct, or from habit;
while the function of higher thought and of will is
to organize and apply these impulses. To revert
to an illustration already suggested, the voluntary is
related to the involuntary very much as the captain
of a ship is related to the seamen and subordinate
officers. Their work is not altogether of a different
sort from his, but is of a lower grade in a mental
series. He supplies the higher sort of co-ordination,
but the main bulk of the activity is of the mentally
lower order.</p>

<p class='c012'>The chief reason why popular attention should fix
itself upon voluntary thought and action, and tend to
overlook the involuntary, is that choice is acutely
conscious, and so must, from its very nature, be the
focus of introspective thought. Because he <em>is</em> an
individual, a specialized, contending bit of psychical
force, a man very naturally holds his will, in its
individual aspect, to be of supreme moment. If we
did not feel a great importance in the things we do
we could not will to do them. And in the life of
other people voluntary action seems supreme, for
very much the same reasons that it does in our own.
It is always in the foreground, active, obvious, intrusive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the thing that creates differences and so fixes
the attention. We notice nothing except through
contrast; and accordingly the mechanical control of
suggestion, affecting all very much alike, is usually
unperceived. As we do not notice the air, precisely
because it is always with us, so, for the same reason,
we do not notice a prevailing mode of dress. In like
manner we are ignorant of our local accent and bearing,
and are totally unaware, for the most part, of
all that is common to our time, our country, our customary
environment. Choice is a central area of
light and activity upon which our eyes are fixed;
while the unconscious is a dark, illimitable background
enveloping this area. Or, again, choice is
like the earth, which we unconsciously assume to be
the principal part of creation, simply because it is
the centre of our interest and the field of our exertions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The practical limitations upon the scope of choice
arise, first, from its very nature as a selective and
organizing agent, working upon comparatively simple
or suggestive ideas as its raw material, and, second,
from the fact that it absorbs a great deal of vital
energy. Owing to the first circumstance its activity
is always confined to points where there is a competition
of ideas. So long as an idea is uncontradicted,
not felt to be in any way inconsistent with others, we
take it as a matter of course. It is a truth, though
hard for us to realize, that if we had lived in Dante’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>time we should have believed in a material Hell,
Purgatory, and Paradise, as he did, and that our
doubts of this, and of many other things which his
age did not question, have nothing to do with our
natural intelligence, but are made possible and necessary
by competing ideas which the growth of knowledge
has enabled us to form. Our particular minds
or wills are members of a slowly growing whole, and
at any given moment are limited in scope by the state
of the whole, and especially of those parts of the
whole with which they are in most active contact.
Our thought is never isolated, but always some sort of
a response to the influences around us, so that we can
hardly have thoughts that are not in some way aroused
by communication. Will—free will if you choose—is
thus a co-operative whole, not an aggregation of
disconnected fragments, and the freedom of the individual
is freedom under law, like that of the good
citizen, not anarchy. We learn to speak by the
exercise of will, but no one, I suppose, will assert
that an infant who hears only French is free to learn
English. Where suggestions are numerous and conflicting
we feel the need to choose; to make these
choices is the function of will, and the result of them
is a step in the progress of life, an act of freedom or
creation, if you wish to call it so; but where suggestion
is single, as with religious dogma in ages of faith,
we are very much at its mercy. We do not perceive
these limitations, because there is no point of vantage
from which we can observe and measure the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>state of thought; there is nothing to compare it with.
Only when it begins to change, when competing suggestions
enter our minds and we get new points of
view from which we can look back upon it, do we
begin to notice its power over us.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The exhausting character of choice, of making up
one’s mind, is a matter of common experience. In
some way the mental synthesis, this calling in and
reducing to order the errant population of the mind,
draws severely upon the vital energy, and one of the
invariable signs of fatigue is a dread of making decisions
and assuming responsibility. In our complicated
life the will can, in fact, manage only a small
part of the competing suggestions that are within
our reach. What we are all forced to do is to choose
a field of action which for some reason we look upon
as specially interesting or important, and exercise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>our choice in that; in other matters protecting ourselves,
for the most part, by some sort of mechanical
control—some accepted personal authority, some
local custom, some professional tradition, or the like.
Indeed, to know where and how to narrow the activity
of the will in order to preserve its tone and vigor
for its most essential functions, is a great part of
knowing how to live. An incontinent exercise of
choice wears people out, so that many break down
and yield even essentials to discipline and authority
in some form; while many more wish, at times, to do
so and indulge themselves, perhaps, in Thomas à
Kempis, or “The Christian’s Secret of a Happy Life.”
Not a few so far exhaust the power of self-direction
as to be left drifting at the mercy of undisciplined
passions. There are many roads to degeneracy, and
persons of an eager, strenuous nature not infrequently
take this one.</p>

<p class='c011'>A common instance of the insidious power of <em>milieu</em>
is afforded by the transition from university education
to getting a living. At a university one finds
himself, if he has any vigor of imagination, in one of
the widest environments the world can afford. He
has access to the suggestions of the richest minds of
all times and countries, and has also, or should have,
time and encouragement to explore, in his own way,
this spacious society. It is his business to think, to
aspire, and grow; and if he is at all capable of it he
does so. Philosophy and art and science and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>betterment of mankind are real and living interests
to him, largely because he is in the great stream of
higher thought that flows through libraries. Now
let him graduate and enter, we will say, upon the
lumber business at Kawkawlin. Here he finds the
scope of existence largely taken up with the details
of this industry—wholesome for him in some ways,
but likely to be overemphasized. These and a few
other things are repeated over and over again, dinned
into him, everywhere assumed to be the solid things
of life, so that he must believe in them; while the
rest grows misty and begins to lose hold upon him.
He cannot make things seem real that do not enter
into his experience, and if he resists the narrowing
environment it must be by keeping touch with a
larger world, through books or other personal intercourse,
and by the exercise of imagination. Marcus
Aurelius told himself that he was free to think what
he chose, but it appears that he realized this freedom
by keeping books about him that suggested the kind
of thoughts he chose to think; and it is only in some
such sense as this implies that the assertion is true.
When the palpable environment does not suit us we
can, if our minds are vigorous enough, build up a
better one out of remembered material; but we must
have material of some sort.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is easy to feel the effect of surroundings in such
cases as this, because of the sharp and definite
change, and because the imagination clings to one
state long after the senses are subdued to the other;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>but it is not so with national habits and sentiments,
which so completely envelop us that we are for the
most part unaware of them. The more thoroughly
American a man is the less he can perceive Americanism.
He will embody it; all he does, says, or
writes, will be full of it; but he can never truly see
it, simply because he has no exterior point of view
from which to look at it. If he goes to Europe he
begins to get by contrast some vague notion of it,
though he will never be able to see just what it is
that makes futile his attempts to seem an Englishman,
a German, or an Italian. Our appearance to
other peoples is like one’s own voice, which one
never hears quite as others hear it, and which sounds
strange when it comes back from the phonograph.</p>

<p class='c012'>The control of those larger movements of thought
and sentiment that make a historical epoch is still
less conscious, more inevitable. Only the imaginative
student, in his best hours, can really free himself—and
that only in some respects—from the limitations
of his time and see things from a height. For
the most part the people of other epochs seem
strange, outlandish, or a little insane. We can
scarcely rid ourselves of the impression that the way
of life we are used to is the normal, and that other
ways are eccentric. Dr. Sidis holds that the people
of the Middle Ages were in a quasi-hypnotic state,
and instances the crusades, dancing manias, and the
like.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> But the question is, would not our own time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>viewed from an equal distance, appear to present the
signs of abnormal suggestibility? Will not the intense
preoccupation with material production, the
hurry and strain of our cities, the draining of life
into one channel, at the expense of breadth, richness,
and beauty, appear as mad as the crusades, and perhaps
of a lower type of madness? Could anything be
more indicative of a slight but general insanity than
the aspect of the crowd on the streets of Chicago?</p>

<p class='c012'>An illustration of this unconsciousness of what is
distinctive in our time is the fact that those who participate
in momentous changes have seldom any but
the vaguest notion of their significance. There is
perhaps no time in the history of art that seems to
us now so splendid, so dramatic, as that of the sudden
rise of Gothic architecture in northern France,
and the erection of the church of St. Denis at Paris
was its culmination: yet Professor C. E. Norton,
speaking of the Abbot Suger, who erected it, and of
his memoirs, says, “Under his watchful and intelligent
oversight the church became the most splendid
and the most interesting building of the century; but
of the features that gave it special interest, that make
it one of the most important monuments of mediæval
architecture, neither Suger, in his account of it, nor
his biographer, nor any contemporary writer, says a
single word.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> To Suger and his time the Gothic,
it would seem, was simply a new and improved way
of building a church, a technical matter with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>he had little concern, except to see that it was duly
carried out according to specifications. It was developed
by draughtsmen and handicraftsmen, mostly
nameless, who felt their own thrill of constructive
delight as they worked, but had no thought of historical
glory. It is no doubt the same in our own
time, and Mr. Bryce has noted with astonishment
the unconsciousness or indifference of those who
founded cities in western America, to the fact that
they were doing something that would be memorable
and influential for ages.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>I have already said, or implied, that the activity
of the will reflects the state of the social order. A
constant and strenuous exercise of volition implies
complexity in the surrounding life from which suggestions
come, while in a simple society choice is
limited in scope and life is comparatively mechanical.
It is the variety of social intercourse or, what
comes to the same thing, the character of social
organization, that determines the field of choice;
and accordingly there is a tendency for the scope
of the will to increase with that widening and intensification
of life that is so conspicuous a feature
of recent history. This change is bound up with the
extension and diffusion of communication, opening
up innumerable channels by which competing suggestions
may enter the mind. We are still dependent
upon environment—life is always a give and take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>with surrounding conditions—but environment is becoming
very wide, and in the case of imaginative
persons may extend itself to almost any ideas that
the past or present life of the race has brought into
being. This brings opportunity for congenial choice
and characteristic personal growth, and at the same
time a good deal of distraction and strain. There is
more and more need of stability, and of a vigorous
rejection of excessive material, if one would escape
mental exhaustion and degeneracy. Choice is like a
river; it broadens as it comes down through history—though
there are always banks—and the wider it
becomes the more persons drown in it. Stronger
and stronger swimming is required, and types of
character that lack vigor and self-reliance are more
and more likely to go under.</p>

<p class='c011'>The aptitude to yield to impulse in a mechanical
or reflex way is called suggestibility. As might be
expected, it is subject to great variations in different
persons, and in the same person under different conditions.
Abnormal suggestibility has received much
study, and there is a great body of valuable literature
relating to it. I wish in this connection only to recall
a few well-known principles which the student
of normal social life needs to have in mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>As would naturally follow from our analysis of the
relation between suggestion and choice, suggestibility
is simply the absence of the controlling and organizing
action of the reflective will. This function not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>being properly performed, thought and action are
disintegrated and fly off on tangents; the captain
being disabled the crew breaks up into factions,
and discipline goes to pieces. Accordingly, whatever
weakens the reason, and thus destroys the breadth
and symmetry of consciousness, produces some form
of suggestibility. To be excited is to be suggestible,
that is to become liable to yield impulsively to an
idea in harmony with the exciting emotion. An
angry man is suggestible as regards denunciation,
threats, and the like, a jealous one as regards suspicions,
and similarly with any passion.</p>

<p class='c012'>The suggestibility of crowds is a peculiar form of
that limitation of choice by the environment already
discussed. We have here a very transient environment
which owes its power over choice to the vague
but potent emotion so easily generated in dense aggregates.
The thick humanity is in itself exciting,
and the will is further stupefied by the sense of insignificance,
by the strangeness of the situation, and by
the absence, as a rule, of any separate purpose to
maintain an independent momentum. A man is like a
ship in that he cannot guide his course unless he has
way on. If he drifts he will shift about with any
light air; and the man in the crowd is usually drifting,
is not pursuing any settled line of action in which
he is sustained by knowledge and habit. This state
of mind, added to intense emotion directed by some
series of special suggestions, is the source of the
wild and often destructive behavior of crowds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>mobs, as well as of a great deal of heroic enthusiasm.
An orator, for instance, first unifying and heightening
the emotional state of his audience by some humorous
or pathetic incident, will be able, if tolerably skilful,
to do pretty much as he pleases with them, so long
as he does not go against their settled habits of
thought. Anger, always a ready passion, is easily
aroused, appeals to resentment being the staples of
much popular oratory, and under certain conditions
readily expresses itself in stoning, burning, and lynching.
And so with fear: General Grant in describing
the battle of Shiloh gives a picture of several
thousand men on a hill-side in the rear, incapable of
moving, though threatened to be shot for cowardice
where they lay. Yet these very men, calmed and
restored to their places, were among those who heroically
fought and won the next day’s battle. They
had been restored to the domination of another class
of suggestions, namely those implied in military
discipline.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Suggestibility from exhaustion or strain is a rather
common condition with many of us. Probably all
eager brain workers find themselves now and then
in a state where they are “too tired to stop.” The
overwrought mind loses the healthy power of casting
off its burden, and seems capable of nothing
but going on and on in the same painful and futile
course. One may know that he is accomplishing
nothing, that work done in such a state of mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>is always bad work, and that “that way madness
lies,” but yet be too weak to resist, chained to the
wheel of his thought so that he must wait till it runs
down. And such a state, however induced, is the
opportunity for all sorts of undisciplined impulses,
perhaps some gross passion, like anger, dread, the
need of drink, or the like.</p>

<p class='c012'>According to Mr. Tylor,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> fasting, solitude, and
physical exhaustion by dancing, shouting, or flagellation
are very generally employed by savage peoples
to bring on abnormal states of mind of which suggestibility—the
sleep of choice, and control by some
idea from the subconscious life—is always a trait.
The visions and ecstasies following the fastings,
watchings, and flagellations of Christian devotees of
an earlier time seem to belong, psychologically, in
much the same category.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is well known that suggestibility is limited by
habit, or, more accurately stated, that habit is itself
a perennial source of suggestions that set bounds and
conditions upon the power of fresh suggestions. A
total abstainer will resist the suggestion to drink, a
modest person will refuse to do anything indecent,
and so on. People are least liable to yield to irrational
suggestions, to be stampeded with the crowd,
in matters with which they are familiar, so that they
have habits regarding them. The soldier, in his
place in the ranks and with his captain in sight, will
march forward to certain death, very likely without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>any acute emotion whatever, simply because he has
the habits that constitute discipline; and so with
firemen, policemen, sailors, brakemen, physicians,
and many others who learn to deal with life and
death as calmly as they read a newspaper. It is all
in the day’s work.</p>

<p class='c012'>As regards the greater or less suggestibility of different
persons there is, of course, no distinct line between
the normal and the abnormal; it is simply a
matter of the greater or less efficiency of the higher
mental organization. Most people, perhaps, are so
far suggestible that they make no energetic and persistent
attempt to interpret in any broad way the
elements of life accessible to them, but receive the
stamp of some rather narrow and simple class of suggestions
to which their allegiance is yielded. There
are innumerable people of much energy but sluggish
intellect, who will go ahead—as all who have energy
must do—but what direction they take is a matter of
the opportune suggestion. The humbler walks of
religion and philanthropy, for instance, the Salvation
Army, the village prayer-meeting, and the city mission,
are full of such. They do not reason on general
topics, but believe and labor. The intellectual
travail of the time does not directly touch them. At
some epoch in the past, perhaps in some hour of
emotional exaltation, something was printed on their
minds to remain there till death, and be read and
followed daily. To the philosopher such people
are fanatics; but their function is as important as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>his. They are repositories of moral energy—which
he is very likely to lack—they are the people who
brought in Christianity and have kept it going ever
since. And this is only one of many comparatively
automatic types of mankind. Rationality, in the
sense of a patient and open-minded attempt to think
out the general problems of life, is, and perhaps always
must be, confined to a small minority even of
the most intelligent populations.</p>

<p class='c011'>To any but a mother a new-born child hardly seems
human. It appears rather to be a strange little animal,
wonderful indeed, exquisitely finished even to the
finger-nails; mysterious, awakening a fresh sense of
our ignorance of the nearest things of life, but not
friendly, not lovable. It is only after some days that
a kindly nature begins to express itself and to grow
into something that can be sympathized with and
personally cared for. The earliest signs of it are
chiefly certain smiles and babbling sounds, which are
a matter of fascinating observation to anyone interested
in the genesis of social feeling.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Spasmodic smiles or grimaces occur even during
the first week of life, and at first seem to mean nothing
in particular. I have watched the face of an
infant a week old while a variety of expressions,
smiles, frowns, and so on, passed over it in rapid
succession: it was as if the child were rehearsing a
repertory of emotional expression belonging to it by
instinct. So soon as they can be connected with
anything definite these rudimentary smiles appear to
be a sign of satisfaction. Mrs. Moore says that her
child smiled on the sixth day “when comfortable,”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
and that this “never occurred when the child was
known to be in pain.” Preyer notes a smile on the
face of a sleeping child, after nursing, on the tenth
day.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> They soon begin to connect themselves quite
definitely with sensible objects, such as bright color,
voices, movements, and fondling. At the same time
the smile gradually develops from a grimace into a
subtler, more human expression, and Dr. Perez, who
seems to have studied a large number of children, says
that all whom he observed smiled, when pleased, by
the time they were two months old.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> When a child
is, say, five months old, no doubt can remain, in most
cases, that the smile has become an expression of
pleasure in the movements, sounds, touches, and
general appearance of other people. It would seem,
however, that personal feeling is not at first clearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>differentiated from pleasures of sight, sound, and
touch of other origin, or from animal satisfactions
having no obvious cause. Both of my children
expended much of their early sociability on inanimate
objects, such as a red Japanese screen, a swinging
lamp, a bright door-knob, an orange, and the
like, babbling and smiling at them for many minutes
at a time; and M., when about three months old and
later, would often lie awake laughing and chattering
in the dead of night. The general impression left
upon one is that the early manifestations of sociability
indicate less fellow-feeling than the adult imagination
likes to impute, but are expressions of a
pleasure which persons excite chiefly because they
offer such a variety of stimuli to sight, hearing, and
touch; or, to put it otherwise, kindliness, while existing
almost from the first, is vague and undiscriminating,
has not yet become fixed upon its proper
objects, but flows out upon all the pleasantness the
child finds about him, like that of St. Francis, when,
in his “Canticle of the Sun,” he addresses the sun
and the moon, stars, winds, clouds, fire, earth, and
water, as brothers and sisters. Indeed, there is nothing
about personal feeling which sharply marks it
off from other feeling; here as elsewhere we find no
fences, but gradual transition, progressive differentiation.</p>

<p class='c012'>I do not think that early smiles are imitative. I
observed both my children carefully to discover
whether they smiled in response to a smile, and obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>negative results when they were under ten
months old. A baby does not smile by imitation,
but because he is pleased; and what pleases him in
the first year of life is usually some rather obvious
stimulus to the senses. If you wish a smile you
must earn it by acceptable exertion; it does no good
to smirk. The belief that many people seem to have
that infants respond to smiling is possibly due to the
fact that when a grown-up person appears, both he
and the infant are likely to smile, each at the other;
but although the smiles are simultaneous one need
not be the cause of the other, and many observations
lead me to think that it makes no difference to the
infant whether the grown-up person smiles or not.
He has not yet learned to appreciate this rather subtle
phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c012'>At this and at all later ages the delight in companionship
so evident in children may be ascribed partly
to specific social emotion or sentiment, and partly to
a need of stimulating suggestions to enable them to
gratify their instinct for various sorts of mental and
physical activity. The influence of the latter appears
in their marked preference for active persons, for
grown-up people who will play with them—provided
they do so with tact—and especially for other children.
It is the same throughout life; alone one is
like fireworks without a match: he cannot set himself
off, but is a victim of <em>ennui</em>, the prisoner of some tiresome
train of thought that holds his mind simply
by the absence of a competitor. A good companion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>brings release and fresh activity, the primal delight
in a fuller existence. So with the child: what excitement
when visiting children come! He shouts,
laughs, jumps about, produces his playthings and all
his accomplishments. He needs to express himself,
and a companion enables him to do so. The shout
of another boy in the distance gives him the joy of
shouting in response.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the need is for something more than muscular
or sensory activities. There is also a need of feeling,
an overflowing of personal emotion and sentiment,
set free by the act of communication. By the time a
child is a year old the social feeling that at first is
indistinguishable from sensuous pleasure has become
much specialized upon persons, and from that time
onward to call it forth by reciprocation is a chief aim
of his life. Perhaps it will not be out of place to
emphasize this by transcribing two or three notes
taken from life.</p>

<p class='c014'>“M. will now [eleven months old] hold up something
she has found, <em>e. g.</em>, the petal of a flower, or a little stick,
demanding your attention to it by grunts and squeals.
When you look and make some motion or exclamation she
smiles.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“R. [four years old] talks all day long, to real companions,
if they will listen, if not to imaginary ones. As I sit
on the steps this morning he seems to wish me to share his
every thought and sensation. He describes everything he
does, although I can see it, saying, ‘Now I’m digging up
little stones,’ etc. I must look at the butterfly, feel of the
fuzz on the clover stems, and try to squawk on the dandelion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>stems. Meanwhile he is reminded of what happened
some other time, and he gives me various anecdotes of what
he and other people did and said. He thinks aloud. If I
seem not to listen he presently notices it and will come up
and touch me, or bend over and look up into my face.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“R. [about the same time] is hilariously delighted and
excited when he can get anyone to laugh or wonder with
him at his pictures, etc. He himself always shares by anticipation,
and exaggerates the feeling he expects to produce.
When B. was calling, R., with his usual desire to
entertain guests, brought out his pull-book, in which pulling
a strip of pasteboard transforms the picture. When he
prepared to work this he was actually shaking with eagerness—apparently
in anticipation of the coming surprise.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I watch E. and R. [four and a half years old] playing
McGinty on the couch and guessing what card will turn
up. R. is in a state of intense excitement which breaks out
in boisterous laughter and all sorts of movements of the
head and limbs. He is full of an emotion which has very
little to do with mere curiosity or surprise relating to the
card.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I take it that the child has by heredity a generous
capacity and need for social feeling, rather too vague
and plastic to be given any specific name like love.
It is not so much any particular personal emotion or
sentiment as the undifferentiated material of many:
perhaps sociability is as good a word for it as any.</p>

<p class='c012'>And this material, like all other instinct, allies itself
with social experience to form, as time goes on,
a growing and diversifying body of personal thought,
in which the phases of social feeling developed correspond,
in some measure, to the complexity of life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>itself. It is a process of organization, involving progressive
differentiation and integration, such as we
see everywhere in nature.</p>

<p class='c012'>In children and in simple-minded adults, kindly
feeling may be very strong and yet very naïve, involving
little insight into the emotional states of
others. A child who is extremely sociable, bubbling
over with joy in companionship, may yet show a
total incomprehension of pain and a scant regard for
disapproval and punishment that does not take the
form of a cessation of intercourse. In other words,
there is a sociability that asks little from others except
bodily presence and an occasional sign of attention,
and often learns to supply even these by imagination.
It seems nearly or quite independent of
that power of interpretation which is the starting-point
of true sympathy. While both of my children
were extremely sociable, R. was not at all sympathetic
in the sense of having quick insight into
others’ states of feeling.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sociability in this simple form is an innocent, unself-conscious
joy, primary and unmoral, like all simple
emotion. It may shine with full brightness from
the faces of idiots and imbeciles, where it sometimes
alternates with fear, rage, or lust. A visitor to an
institution where large numbers of these classes are
collected will be impressed, as I have been, with the
fact that they are as a rule amply endowed with those
kindly impulses which some appear to look upon as
almost the sole requisite for human welfare. It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>singular and moving fact that there is a class of cases,
mostly women, I think, in whom kindly emotion is so
excitable as to be a frequent source of hysterical
spasms, so that it has to be discouraged by frowns
and apparent harshness on the part of those in
charge. The chief difference between normal people
and imbeciles in this regard is that, while the former
have more or less of this simple kindliness in them,
social emotion is also elaborately compounded and
worked up by the mind into an indefinite number of
complex passions and sentiments, corresponding to
the relations and functions of an intricate life.</p>

<p class='c011'>When left to themselves children continue the joys
of sociability by means of an imaginary playmate.
Although all must have noticed this who have observed
children at all, only close and constant observation
will enable one to realize the extent to
which it is carried on. It is not an occasional practice,
but, rather, a necessary form of thought, flowing
from a life in which personal communication is the
chief interest and social feeling the stream in which,
like boats on a river, most other feelings float. Some
children appear to live in personal imaginations almost
from the first month; others occupy their
minds in early infancy mostly with solitary experiments
upon blocks, cards, and other impersonal objects,
and their thoughts are doubtless filled with the
images of these. But, in either case, after a child
learns to talk and the social world in all its wonder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>and provocation opens on his mind, it floods his imagination
so that all his thoughts are conversations.
He is never alone. Sometimes the inaudible interlocutor
is recognizable as the image of a tangible
playmate, sometimes he appears to be purely imaginary.
Of course each child has his own peculiarities.
R., beginning when about three years of age,
almost invariably talked aloud while he was playing
alone—which, as he was a first child, was very often
the case. Most commonly he would use no form of
address but “you,” and perhaps had no definite person
in mind. To listen to him was like hearing one
at the telephone; though occasionally he would give
both sides of the conversation. At times again he
would be calling upon some real name, Esyllt or
Dorothy, or upon “Piggy,” a fanciful person of his
own invention. Every thought seemed to be spoken
out. If his mother called him he would say, “I’ve
got to go in now.” Once when he slipped down on
the floor he was heard to say, “Did you tumble
down? No. <em>I</em> did.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The main point to note here is that these conversations
are not occasional and temporary effusions of
the imagination, but are the naïve expression of a
socialization of the mind that is to be permanent
and to underly all later thinking. The imaginary
dialogue passes beyond the thinking aloud of little
children into something more elaborate, reticent, and
sophisticated; but it never ceases. Grown people,
like children, are usually unconscious of these dialogues;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>as we get older we cease, for the most part,
to carry them on out loud, and some of us practise
a good deal of apparently solitary meditation and experiment.
But, speaking broadly, it is true of adults
as of children, that the mind lives in perpetual conversation.
It is one of those things that we seldom
notice just because they are so familiar and involuntary;
but we can perceive it if we try to. If one
suddenly stops and takes note of his thoughts at
some time when his mind has been running free, as
when he is busy with some simple mechanical work,
he will be likely to find them taking the form of
vague conversations. This is particularly true when
one is somewhat excited with reference to a social
situation. If he feels under accusation or suspicion
in any way he will probably find himself making a
defence, or perhaps a confession, to an imaginary
hearer. A guilty man confesses “to get the load off
his mind;” that is to say, the excitement of his thought
cannot stop there but extends to the connected impulses
of expression and creates an intense need to
tell somebody. Impulsive people often talk out loud
when excited, either “to themselves,” as we say when
we can see no one else present, or to anyone whom
they can get to listen. Dreams also consist very
largely of imaginary conversations; and, with some
people at least, the mind runs in dialogue during the
half-waking state before going to sleep. There are
many other familiar facts that bear the same interpretation—such,
for instance, as that it is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>easier for most people to compose in the form of letters
or dialogue than in any other; so that literature
of this kind has been common in all ages.</p>

<p class='c012'>Goethe, in giving an account of how he came to
write “Werther” as a series of letters, discusses the
matter with his usual perspicuity, and lets us see
how habitually conversational was his way of thinking.
Speaking of himself in the third person, he
says: “Accustomed to pass his time most pleasantly
in society, he changed even solitary thought into social
converse, and this in the following manner: He
had the habit, when he was alone, of calling before
his mind any person of his acquaintance. This person
he entreated to sit down, walked up and down
by him, remained standing before him, and discoursed
with him on the subject he had in mind.
To this the person answered as occasion required, or
by the ordinary gestures signified his assent or dissent—in
which every man has something peculiar to
himself. The speaker then continued to carry out
further that which seemed to please the guest, or to
condition and define more closely that of which he
disapproved; and finally was polite enough to give
up his own notion.... How nearly such a dialogue
is akin to a written correspondence is clear
enough; only in the latter one sees returned the
confidence one has bestowed, while in the former one
creates for himself a confidence which is new, everchanging
and unreturned.”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> “Accustomed to pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>his time most pleasantly in society, he changed even
solitary thought into social converse,” is not only a
particular but a general truth, more or less applicable
to all thought. The fact is that language, developed
by the race through personal intercourse and
imparted to the individual in the same way, can
never be dissociated from personal intercourse in the
mind; and since higher thought involves language, it
is always a kind of imaginary conversation. The
word and the interlocutor are correlative ideas.</p>

<p class='c011'>The impulse to communicate is not so much a result
of thought as it is an inseparable part of it.
They are like root and branch, two phases of a common
growth, so that the death of one presently involves
that of the other. Psychologists now teach
that every thought involves an active impulse as
part of its very nature; and this impulse, with reference
to the more complex and socially developed
forms of thought, takes the shape of a need to talk,
to write, and so on; and if none of these is practicable,
it expends itself in a wholly imaginary communication.</p>

<p class='c012'>Montaigne, who understood human nature as well,
perhaps, as anyone who ever lived, remarks: “There
is no pleasure to me without communication: there
is not so much as a sprightly thought comes into my
mind that it does not grieve me to have produced
alone, and that I have no one to tell it to.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> And it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>was doubtless because he had many such thoughts
which no one was at hand to appreciate, that he
took to writing essays. The uncomprehended of all
times and peoples have kept diaries for the same reason.
So, in general, a true creative impulse in literature
or art is, in one aspect, an expression of this
simple, childlike need to think aloud or <em>to</em> somebody;
to define and vivify thought by imparting it
to an imaginary companion; by developing that
communicative element which belongs to its very
nature, and without which it cannot live and grow.
Many authors have confessed that they always think
of some person when they write, and I am inclined
to believe that this is always more or less definitely
the case, though the writer himself may not be aware
of it. Emerson somewhere says that “the man is
but half himself; the other half is his expression,”
and this is literally true. The man comes to be
through some sort of expression, and has no higher
existence apart from it; overt or imaginary it takes
place all the time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Men apparently solitary, like Thoreau, are often
the best illustrations of the inseparability of thought
and life from communication. No sympathetic reader
of his works, I should say, can fail to see that he
took to the woods and fields not because he lacked
sociability, but precisely because his sensibilities
were so keen that he needed to rest and protect
them by a peculiar mode of life, and to express them
by the indirect and considerate method of literature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>No man ever labored more passionately to communicate,
to give and receive adequate expression, than
he did. This may be read between the lines in all
his works, and is recorded in his diary. “I would
fain communicate the wealth of my life to men, would
really give them what is most precious in my gift. I
would secrete pearls with the shell-fish and lay up
honey with the bees for them. I will sift the sunbeams
for the public good. I know no riches I
would keep back. I have no private good unless it
be my peculiar ability to serve the public. This is
the only individual property. Each one may thus
be innocently rich. I enclose and foster the pearl
till it is grown. I wish to communicate those parts
of my life which I would gladly live again.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> This
shows, I think, a just notion of the relation between
the individual and society, privacy and publicity.
There is, in fact, a great deal of sound sociology in
Thoreau.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since, therefore, the need to impart is of this primary
and essential character, we ought not to look
upon it as something separable from and additional
to the need to think or to be; it is only by imparting
that one is enabled to think or to be. Everyone,
in proportion to his natural vigor, necessarily
strives to communicate to others that part of his life
which he is trying to unfold in himself. It is a
matter of self-preservation, because without expression
thought cannot live. Imaginary conversation—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>is, conversation carried on without the stimulus
of a visible and audible response—may satisfy the
needs of the mind for a long time. There is, indeed,
an advantage to a vigorously constructive and yet impressible
imagination in restricting communication;
because in this way ideas are enabled to have a clearer
and more independent development than they
could have if continually disturbed by criticism or
opposition. Thus artists, men of letters, and productive
minds of all sorts often find it better to keep
their productions to themselves until they are fully
matured. But, after all, the response must come
sooner or later or thought itself will perish. The
imagination, in time, loses the power to create an interlocutor
who is not corroborated by any fresh experience.
If the artist finds no appreciator for his
book or picture he will scarcely be able to produce
another.</p>

<p class='c012'>People differ much in the vividness of their imaginative
sociability. The more simple, concrete, dramatic,
their habit of mind is, the more their thinking
is carried on in terms of actual conversation with
a visible and audible interlocutor. Women, as a rule,
probably do this more vividly than men, the unlettered
more vividly than those trained to abstract
thought, and the sort of people we call emotional
more vividly than the impassive. Moreover, the interlocutor
is a very mutable person, and is likely to
resemble the last strong character we have been in
contact with. I have noticed, for instance, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>when I take up a book after a person of decided and
interesting character has been talking with me I am
likely to hear the words of the book in his voice.
The same is true of opinions, moral standards, and
the like, as well as of physical traits. In short, the
interlocutor, who is half of all thought and life, is
drawn from the accessible environment.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is worth noting here that there is no separation
between real and imaginary persons; indeed, to be
imagined is to become real, in a social sense, as I
shall presently point out. An invisible person may
easily be more real to an imaginative mind than a
visible one; sensible presence is not necessarily a
matter of the first importance. A person can be real
to us only in the degree in which we imagine an inner
life which exists in us, for the time being, and which
we refer to him. The sensible presence is important
chiefly in stimulating us to do this. All real persons
are imaginary in this sense. If, however, we
use imaginary in the sense of illusory, an imagination
not corresponding to fact, it is easy to see that visible
presence is no bar to illusion. Thus I meet a stranger
on the steamboat who corners me and tells me
his private history. I care nothing for it, and he
half knows that I do not; he uses me only as a lay
figure to sustain the agreeable illusion of sympathy,
and is talking to an imaginary companion quite as
he might if I were elsewhere. So likewise good
manners are largely a tribute to imaginary companionship,
a make believe of sympathy which it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>agreeable to accept as real, though we may know,
when we think, that it is not. To conceive a kindly
and approving companion is something that one involuntarily
tries to do, in accordance with that instinctive
hedonizing inseparable from all wholesome
mental processes, and to assist in this by at least a
seeming of friendly appreciation is properly regarded
as a part of good breeding. To be always sincere
would be brutally to destroy this pleasant and mostly
harmless figment of the imagination.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the imaginary companionship which a child
of three or four years so naïvely creates and expresses,
is something elementary and almost omnipresent in
the thought of a normal person. In fact, thought
and personal intercourse may be regarded as merely
aspects of the same thing: we call it personal intercourse
when the suggestions that keep it going are
received through faces or other symbols present to
the senses; reflection when the personal suggestions
come through memory and are more elaborately
worked over in thought. But both are mental, both
are personal. Personal images, as they are connected
with nearly all our higher thought in its inception,
remain inseparable from it in memory. The mind is
not a hermit’s cell, but a place of hospitality and
intercourse. We have no higher life that is really
apart from other people. It is by imagining them
that our personality is built up; to be without the
power of imagining them is to be a low-grade idiot;
and in the measure that a mind is lacking in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>power it is degenerate. Apart from this mental society
there is no wisdom, no power, justice, or right,
no higher existence at all. The life of the mind is
essentially a life of intercourse.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us now consider somewhat more carefully the
way in which ideas of people grow up in the mind,
and try to make out, as nearly as we can, their real
nature and significance.</p>

<p class='c012'>The studies through which the child learns, in time,
to interpret personal expression are very early begun.
On her twelfth day M. was observed to get her eyes
upon her mother’s face; and after gazing for some
time at it she seemed attracted to the eyes, into which
she looked quite steadily. From the end of the first
month this face study was very frequent and long-continued.
Doubtless anyone who notices infants
could multiply indefinitely observations like the following:</p>

<p class='c014'>“M., in her eighth week, lies in her mother’s lap gazing
up at her face with a frown of fixed and anxious attention.
Evidently the play of the eyes and lips, the flashing
of the teeth, and the wrinkles of expression are the object
of her earnest study. So also the coaxing noises which are
made to please her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She now [four months and twenty-one days old] seems
to fix her attention almost entirely upon the eyes, and will
stare at them for a minute or more with the most intent
expression.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The eye seems to receive most notice. As Perez
says: “The eye is one of the most interesting and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>attractive of objects; the vivacity of the pupil set in
its oval background of white, its sparkles, its darts
of light, its tender looks, its liquid depths, attract
and fascinate a young child....”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The mouth
also gets much attention, especially when in movement;
I have sometimes noticed a child who is looking
into the eyes turn from them to the mouth when
the person commences to talk: the flashing of the
teeth then adds to its interest. The voice is also the
object of close observation. The intentness with
which a child listens to it, the quickness with which
he learns to distinguish different voices and different
inflections of the same voice, and the fact that vocal
imitation precedes other sorts, all show this. It
cannot fail to strike the observer that observation
of these traits is not merely casual, but a strenuous
study, often accompanied by a frown of earnest attention.
The mind is evidently aroused, something important
is going on, something conscious, voluntary,
eager. It would seem likely that this something is
the storing up, arrangement, and interpretation of
those images of expression which remain throughout
life the starting-point of personal imaginations.</p>

<p class='c012'>The wrinkles about the eyes and mouth, which are
perhaps the most expressive parts of the countenance,
would not be so noticeable at first as the eyes, the lips,
and the teeth, but they are always in the field of
vision, and in time their special significance as a seat
of expression comes to be noticed and studied. M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>appeared to understand a smile sufficiently to be
pleased by it about the end of the tenth month. The
first unequivocal case of smiling in response to a
smile was noticed on the twenty-sixth day of this
month. Even at this age smiling is not imitative in
the sense of being a voluntary repetition of the other’s
action, but appears to be merely an involuntary expression
of pleasure. Facial expression is one of the
later things to be imitated, for the reason, apparently,
that the little child cannot be aware of the expression
of his own countenance as he can hear his own voice
or see his own hands; and therefore does not so soon
learn to control it and to make it a means of voluntary
imitation. He learns this only when he comes to
study his features in the looking-glass. This children
do as early as the second year, when they may be
observed experimenting before the mirror with all
sorts of gestures and grimaces.</p>

<p class='c012'>The interpretation of a smile, or of any sort of facial
expression, is apparently learned much as other things
are. By constant study of the face from the first
month the child comes, in time, to associate the
wrinkles that form a smile with pleasant experiences—fondling,
coaxing, offering of playthings or of the
bottle, and so on. Thus the smile comes to be recognized
as a harbinger of pleasure, and so is greeted
with a smile. Its absence, on the other hand, is
associated with inattention and indifference. Toward
the end of the fifth month M., on one occasion, seemed
to notice the change from a smile to a frown, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>stopped smiling herself. However, a number of
observations taken in the tenth month show that
even then it was doubtful whether she could be made
to smile merely by seeing someone else do it; and,
as I say, the first unequivocal case was noticed toward
the end of this month.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such evidence as we have from the direct observation
of children does not seem to me to substantiate
the opinion that we have a definite instinctive sensibility
to facial expression. Whatever hereditary
element there is I imagine to be very vague, and
incapable of producing definite phenomena without
the aid of experience. I experimented upon my own
and some other children with frowns, attempts at
ferocity, and pictures of faces, as well as with smiles—in
order to elicit instinctive apprehension of expression,
but during the first year these phenomena
seemed to produce no definite effect. At about
fifteen months M. appeared to be dismayed by a
savage expression assumed while playing with her,
and at about the same period became very sensitive to
frowns. The impression left upon me was that after
a child learns to expect a smiling face as the concomitant
of kindness, he is puzzled, troubled, or startled
when it is taken away, and moreover learns by experience
that frowns and gravity mean disapproval and
opposition. I imagine that children fail to understand
any facial expression that is quite new to them. An
unfamiliar look, an expression of ferocity for example,
may excite vague alarm simply because it is strange;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>or, as is very likely with children used to kind treatment,
this or any other contortion of the face may be
welcomed with a laugh on the assumption that it is
some new kind of play. I feel sure that observation
will dissipate the notion of any <em>definite</em> instinctive
capacity to interpret the countenance.</p>

<p class='c012'>I might also mention, as having some bearing upon
this question of definite hereditary ideas, that my
children did not show that instinctive fear of animals
that some believe to be implanted in us. R., the
elder, until about three years of age, delighted in
animals, and when taken to the menagerie regarded
the lions and tigers with the calmest interest; but
later, apparently as a result of rude treatment by a
puppy, became exceedingly timid. M. has never, so
far as I know, shown any fear of any animal.</p>

<p class='c012'>As regards sounds, there is no doubt of a vague
instinctive susceptibility, at least to what is harsh—sharp,
or plaintive. Children less than a month old
will show pain at such sounds. A harsh cry, or a
sharp sound like that of a tin horn, will sometimes
make them draw down the mouth and cry even during
the first week.</p>

<p class='c012'>Darwin records that in one of his children sympathy
“was clearly shown at six months and eleven
days by his melancholy face, with the corners of his
mouth well depressed, when his nurse pretended to
cry.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Such manifestations are probably caused
rather by the plaintive voice than by facial expression;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>at any rate, I have never been able to produce
them by the latter alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some believe that young children have an intuition
of personal character quicker and more trustworthy
than that of grown people. If this were so it would
be a strong argument in favor of the existence of a
congenital instinct which does not need experience
and is impaired by it. My own belief is that close
observation of children under two years of age will
lead to the conclusion that personal impressions are
developed by experience. Yet it is possibly true
that children three years old or more are sometimes
quicker and more acute judges of some traits, such
as sincerity and good will, than grown people. In so
far as it is a fact it may perhaps be explained in this
way. The faces that children see and study are
mostly full of the expression of love and truth.
Nothing like it occurs in later life, even to the most
fortunate. These images, we may believe, give rise
in the child’s mind to a more or less definite ideal of
what a true and kindly face should be, and this ideal
he uses with great effect in detecting what falls short
of it. He sees that there is something wrong with
the false smile; it does not fit the image in his mind;
some lines are not there, others are exaggerated.
He does not understand what coldness and insincerity
are, but their expression puzzles and alarms
him, merely because it is not what he is used to.
The adult loses this clear, simple ideal of love and
truth, and the sharp judgment that flows from it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>His perception becomes somewhat vulgarized by a
flood of miscellaneous experience, and he sacrifices
childish spontaneity to wider range and more complex
insight, valuing and studying many traits of
which the child knows nothing. It will not be seriously
maintained that, on the whole, we know people
better when we are children than we do later.</p>

<p class='c012'>I put forward these scanty observations for what
little they may be worth, and not as disproving the
existence of special instincts in which Darwin and
other great observers have believed. I do not maintain
that there is no hereditary aptitude to interpret
facial expression—there must be some sort of an instinctive
basis to start from—but I think that it develops
gradually and in indistinguishable conjunction
with knowledge gained by experience.</p>

<p class='c012'>Apparently, then, voice, facial expression, gesture,
and the like, which later become the vehicle of personal
impressions and the sensible basis of sympathy,
are attractive at first chiefly for their sensuous variety
and vividness, very much as other bright, moving,
sounding things are attractive; and the interpretation
of them comes gradually by the interworking
of instinct and observation. This interpretation is
nothing other than the growth, in connection with
these sensuous experiences, of a system of ideas that
we associate with them. The interpretation of an
angry look, for instance, consists in the expectation of
angry words and acts, in feelings of resentment or
fear, and so on; in short, it is our whole mental reaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to this sign. It may consist in part of sympathetic
states of mind, that is in states of mind that
we suppose the other to experience also; but it is
not confined to such. These ideas that enrich the
meaning of the symbol—the resentment or fear, for
instance—have all, no doubt, their roots in instinct;
we are born with the crude raw material of such
feelings. And it is precisely in the act of communication,
in social contact of some sort, that this
material grows, that it gets the impulses that give it
further definition, refinement, organization. It is by
intercourse with others that we expand our inner experience.
In other words, and this is the point of the
matter, the personal idea consists at first and in all
later development, of a sensuous element or symbol
with which is connected a more or less complex body
of thought and sentiment; the whole social in genesis,
formed by a series of communications.</p>

<p class='c011'>What do we think of when we think of a person?
Is not the nucleus of the thought an image of the
sort just mentioned, some ghost of characteristic expression?
It may be a vague memory of lines around
the mouth and eyes, or of other lines indicating pose,
carriage, or gesture; or it may be an echo of some
tone or inflection of the voice. I am unable, perhaps,
to call up any distinct outline of the features
of my best friend, of my own mother, or my child;
but I can see a smile, a turn of the eyelid, a way of
standing or sitting, indistinct and flitting glimpses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>but potent to call up those past states of feeling of
which personal memories are chiefly formed. The
most real thing in physical presence is not height,
nor breadth, nor the shape of the nose or forehead,
nor that of any other comparatively immobile part of
the body, but it is something in the plastic, expressive
features: these are noticed and remembered because
they tell us what we most care to know.</p>

<p class='c012'>The judgment of personal character seems to take
place in much the same way. We estimate a man, I
think, by imagining what he would do in various situations.
Experience supplies us with an almost infinite
variety of images of men in action, that is of impressions
of faces, tones, and the like, accompanied
by certain other elements making up a situation.
When we wish to judge a new face, voice, and form,
we unconsciously ask ourselves where they would fit;
we try them in various situations, and if they fit, if
we can think of them as doing the things without incongruity,
we conclude that we have that kind of a
man to deal with. If I can imagine a man intimidated,
I do not respect him; if I can imagine him
lying, I do not trust him; if I can see him receiving,
comprehending, resisting men and disposing
them in accordance with his own plans, I ascribe executive
ability to him; if I can think of him in his
study patiently working out occult problems, I judge
him to be a scholar; and so on. The symbol before
us reminds us of some other symbol resembling it,
and this brings with it a whole group of ideas which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>constitutes our personal impression of the new
man.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The power to make these judgments is intuitive,
imaginative, not arrived at by ratiocination, but it is
dependent upon experience. I have no belief in the
theory, which I have seen suggested, that we unconsciously
imitate other people’s expression, and then
judge of their character by noting how we feel when we
look like them. The men of uncommon insight into
character are usually somewhat impassive in countenance
and not given to facial imitation. Most of us
become to some extent judges of the character of dogs,
so that we can tell by the tone of a dog’s bark whether
he is a biting dog or only a barking dog. Surely imitation
can have nothing to do with this; we do not
imitate the dog’s bark to learn whether he is serious
or not; we observe, remember, and imagine; and it
seems to me that we judge people in much the same
way.</p>

<p class='c011'>These visible and audible signs of personality, these
lines and tones whose meaning is impressed upon us
by the intense and constant observation of our childhood,
are also a chief basis of the communication of
impressions in art and literature.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is evidently the case in those arts which imitate
the human face and figure. Painters and illustrators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>give the most minute study to facial expression,
and suggest various sentiments by bits of light
and shade so subtle that the uninitiated cannot see
what or where they are, although their effect is everything
as regards the depiction of personality. It is
the failure to reproduce them that makes the emptiness
of nearly all copies of famous painting or sculpture
that represents the face. Perhaps not one person
in a thousand, comparing the “Mona Lisa” or the
“Beatrice Cenci” with one of the mediocre copies
generally standing near them, can point out where the
painter of the latter has gone amiss; yet the difference
is like that between life and a wax image.
The chief fame of some painters rests upon their
power to portray and suggest certain rare kinds of
feeling. Thus the people of Fra Angelico express to
the eye the higher love, described in words by St.
Paul and Thomas à Kempis. It is a distinctly human
and social sentiment; his persons are nearly
always in pairs, and, in his Paradise for instance,
almost every face among the blest is directed in rapture
toward some other face. Other painters, as
Botticelli and Perugino—alike in this respect though
not in most—depict a more detached sort of sentiment;
and their people look out of the picture in
isolated ecstasy or meditation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sculpture appeals more to reminiscence of attitude,
facial expression being somewhat subordinate, though
here also the difference between originals and copies
is largely in the lines of the eyes and mouth, too delicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to be reproduced by the mechanical instruments
which copy broader outlines quite exactly.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to literature, it is enough to recall the fact that
words allusive to traits of facial expression, and especially
to the eye, are the immemorial and chosen
means of suggesting personality.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> To poetry, which
seeks the sensuous nucleus of thought, the eye is very
generally the person; as when Shakespeare says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>I all alone beweep my outcast state....”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>or Milton:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Poetry, however, usually refrains from minute
description of expression, a thing impossible in words,
and strikes for a vivid, if inexact, impression, by the
use of such phrases as “a fiery eye,” “a liquid eye,”
and “The poet’s eye in a fine frenzy rolling.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>We also get from every art a personal impression
that does not come from the imitation of features and
tones, nor from a description of these in words, but is
the personality of the author himself, subtly communicated
by something that we interpret as signs of his
state of mind. When one reads Motley’s histories he
gets a personal impression not only of the Prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of Orange or Alexander of Parma, but also of Mr.
Motley; and the same is true or may be true of
any work of art, however “objective” it may be.
What we call style, when we say “The style is
the man,” is the equivalent, in the artist’s way of
doing things, of those visible and audible traits of
the form and voice by which we judge people who
are bodily present.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> “Every work of genius,” says
John Burroughs, “has its own physiognomy—sad,
cheerful, frowning, yearning, determined, meditative.”
Just as we are glad of the presence of certain
forms and faces, because of the mood they put
us in, so we are glad of the physiognomy of certain
writers in their books, quite apart from the intellectual
content of what they say; and this is the
subtlest, most durable, most indispensable charm of
all.  Every lover of books has authors whom he reads
over and over again, whom he cares for as persons and
not as sources of information, who are more to him,
possibly, than any person he sees. He continually
returns to the cherished companion and feeds eagerly
upon his thought. It is because there is something
in the book which he needs, which awakens and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>directs trains of thought that lead him where he likes
to be led. The thing that does this is something personal
and hard to define; it is in the words and yet
not in any definite information that they convey. It
is rather an attitude, a way of feeling, communicated
by a style faithful to the writer’s mind. Some people
find pleasure and profit, for example, in perusing
even the somewhat obscure and little inspired portions
of Goethe’s writings, like the “Campaigns in
France”; it would perhaps be impossible to tell why,
further than by saying that they get the feeling of
something calm, free and onward which is Goethe
himself, and not to be had elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so anyone who practises literary composition,
even of a pedestrian sort, will find at least one reward
for his pains in a growing insight into the personality
of great writers. He will come to feel that
such a word was chosen or such a sentence framed in
just that way, under the influence of such a purpose
or sentiment, and by putting these impressions together,
will presently arrive at some personal acquaintance
with any author whose character and
aims are at all congenial with his own.</p>

<p class='c012'>We feel this more in literature than in any other
art, and more in prose of an intimate sort than in any
other kind of literature. The reason appears to be
that writing, particularly writing of a familiar kind,
like letters and autobiographies, is something which
we all practise in one way or another, and which
we can, therefore, interpret; while the methods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>other arts are beyond our imaginations. It is easy
to share the spirit of Charles Lamb writing his Letters,
or of Montaigne dictating his Essays, or of
Thackeray discoursing in the first person about his
characters; because they merely did what all of us
do, only did it better. On the other hand, Michelangelo,
or Wagner, or Shakespeare—except in his
sonnets—remains for most of us personally remote
and inconceivable. But a painter, or a composer, or
a sculptor, or a poet, will always get an impression of
personality, of style, from another artist of the same
sort, because his experience enables him to feel the
subtle indications of mood and method. Mr. Frith,
the painter, says in his autobiography that a picture
“will betray the real character of its author; who, in
the unconscious development of his peculiarities,
constantly presents to the initiated signs by which an
infallible judgment may be pronounced on the painter’s
mind and character.”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> In fact, it is true of any
earnest career that a man expresses his character in
his work, and that another man of similar aims can
read what he expresses. We see in General Grant’s
Memoirs, how an able commander feels the personality
of an opponent in the movements of his armies,
imagines what he will do in various exigencies, and
deals with him accordingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>These personal impressions of a writer or other
artist may or may not be accompanied by a vague
imagination of his visible appearance. Some persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>have so strong a need to think in connection
with visual images that they seem to form no notion
of personality without involuntarily imagining what
the person looks like; while others can have a strong
impression of feeling and purpose that seems not to
be accompanied by any visual picture. There can
be no doubt, however, that sensible images of the
face, voice, etc., usually go with personal ideas. Our
earliest personal conceptions grow up about such
images; and they always remain for most of us the
principal means of getting hold of other people.
Naturally, they have about the same relative place
in memory and imagination as they do in observation.
Probably, if we could get to the bottom of
the matter, it would be found that our impression
of a writer is always accompanied by some
idea of his sensible appearance, is always associated
with a physiognomy, even when we are not aware of
it. Can anyone, for example, read Macaulay and
think of a soft and delicately inflected voice? I
imagine not: these periods must be connected with
a sonorous and somewhat mechanical utterance; the
sort of person that speaks softly and with delicate
inflections would have written otherwise. On the
other hand, in reading Robert Louis Stevenson it is
impossible, I should say, not to get the impression of
a sensitive and flexible speech. Such impressions
are mostly vague and may be incorrect, but for sympathetic
readers they exist and constitute a real,
though subtle, physiognomy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Not only the idea of particular persons but that
of social groups seems to have a sensible basis in
these ghosts of expression. The sentiment by which
one’s family, club, college, state or country is realized
in his mind is stimulated by vague images,
largely personal. Thus the spirit of a college fraternity
seems to come back to me through a memory of
the old rooms and of the faces of friends. The idea
of country is a rich and various one and has connected
with it many sensuous symbols—such as
flags, music, and the rhythm of patriotic poetry—that
are not directly personal; but it is chiefly an
idea of personal traits that we share and like, as set
over against others that are different and repugnant.
We think of America as the land of freedom, simplicity,
cordiality, equality, and so on, in antithesis
to other countries which we suppose to be otherwise—and
we think of these traits by imagining the people
that embody them. For countless school children
patriotism begins in sympathy with our forefathers
in resistance to the hateful oppression and arrogance
of the British, and this fact of early training largely
accounts for the perennial popularity of the anti-British
side in international questions. Where the
country has a permanent ruler to typify it his image
is doubtless a chief element in the patriotic idea.
On the other hand, the impulse which we feel to personify
country, or anything else that awakens strong
emotion in us, shows our imaginations to be so profoundly
personal that deep feeling almost inevitably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>connects itself with a personal image. In short,
group sentiment, in so far as it is awakened by definite
images, is only a variety of personal sentiment.
A sort of vague agitation, however, is sometimes
produced by mere numbers. Thus public opinion
is sometimes thought of as a vast impersonal force,
like a great wind, though ordinarily it is conceived
simply as the opinion of particular persons, whose
expressions or tones are more or less definitely
imagined.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the preceding I have considered the rise of personal
ideas chiefly from the point of view of the
visual or auditory element in them—the personal
symbol or vehicle of communication; but of course
there is a parallel growth in feeling. An infant’s
states of feeling may be supposed to be nearly as
crude as his ideas of the appearance of things; and
the process that gives form, variety, and coherence to
the latter does the same for the former. It is precisely
the act of intercourse, the stimulation of the
mind by a personal symbol, which gives a formative
impulse to the vague mass of hereditary feeling-tendency,
and this impulse, in turn, results in a larger
power of interpreting the symbol. It is not to be
supposed, for instance, that such feelings as generosity,
respect, mortification, emulation, the sense of
honor, and the like, are an original endowment of
the mind. Like all the finer and larger mental life
these arise in conjunction with communication and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>could not exist without it. It is these finer modes of
feeling, these intricate branchings or differentiations
of the primitive trunk of emotion, to which the name
sentiments is usually applied. Personal sentiments
are correlative with personal symbols, the interpretation
of the latter meaning nothing more than that
the former are associated with them; while the sentiments,
in turn, cannot be felt except by the aid of
the symbols. If I see a face and feel that here is
an honest man, it means that I have, in the past,
achieved through intercourse an idea of honest personality,
with the visual elements of which the face
before me has something in common, so that it calls
up this socially achieved sentiment. And moreover
in knowing this honest man my idea of honest
personality will be enlarged and corrected for future
use. Both the sentiment and its visual associations
will be somewhat different from what they
were.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus no personal sentiment is the exclusive product
of any one influence, but all is of various origin
and has a social history. The more clearly one can
grasp this fact the better, at least if I am right in
supposing that a whole system of wrong thinking results
from overlooking it and assuming that personal
ideas are separable and fragmentary elements in the
mind. Of this I shall say more presently. The fact
I mean is that expressed by Shakespeare, with reference
to love, or loving friendship, in his thirty-first
sonnet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which I by lacking have supposed dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there reigns love, and all love’s loving parts,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And all those friends which I thought buried.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
 <div class='line c002'>Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who all their parts of me to thee did give;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That due of many now is thine alone:</div>
      <div class='line'>Their images I loved I view in thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In this sonnet may be discerned, I think, a true
theory of personal sentiment, quite accordant with
the genetic point of view of modern psychology, and
very important in the understanding of social relations.</p>

<p class='c012'>Facial expression, tone of voice, and the like, the
sensible nucleus of personal and social ideas, serve
as the handle, so to speak, of such ideas, the principal
substance of which is drawn from the region of inner
imagination and sentiment. The personality of a
friend, as it lives in my mind and forms there a part
of the society in which I live, is simply a group or
system of thoughts associated with the symbols that
stand for him. To think of him is to revive some
part of the system—to have the old feeling along
with the familiar symbol, though perhaps in a new
connection with other ideas. The real and intimate
thing in him is the thought to which he gives life,
the feeling his presence or memory has the power to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>suggest. This clings about the sensible imagery, the
personal symbols already discussed, because the latter
have served as bridges by which we have entered
other minds and therein enriched our own.
We have laid up stores, but we always need some
help to get at them in order that we may use and increase
them; and this help commonly consists in
something visible or audible, which has been connected
with them in the past and now acts as a key
by which they are unlocked. Thus the face of a
friend has power over us in much the same way as
the sight of a favorite book, of the flag of one’s country,
or the refrain of an old song; it starts a train of
thought, lifts the curtain from an intimate experience.
And his presence does not consist in the
pressure of his flesh upon a neighboring chair, but
in the thoughts clustering about some symbol of
him, whether the latter be his tangible person or
something else. If a person is more his best self in
a letter than in speech, as sometimes happens, he is
more truly present to me in his correspondence than
when I see and hear him. And in most cases a
favorite writer is more with us in his book than he
ever could have been in the flesh; since, being a
writer, he is one who has studied and perfected this
particular mode of personal incarnation, very likely
to the detriment of any other. I should like as a
matter of curiosity to see and hear for a moment the
men whose works I admire; but I should hardly expect
to find further intercourse particularly profitable.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>The world of sentiment and imagination, of all
finer and warmer thought, is chiefly a personal world—that
is, it is inextricably interwoven with personal
symbols. If you try to think of a person you will
find that what you really think is chiefly sentiments
which you connect with his image; and, on the
other hand, if you try to recall a sentiment you will
find, as a rule, that it will not come up except along
with symbols of the persons who have suggested it.
To think of love, gratitude, pity, grief, honor, courage,
justice, and the like, it is necessary to think of
people by whom or toward whom these sentiments
may be entertained.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Thus justice may be recalled
by thinking of Washington, kindness by Lincoln,
honor by Sir Philip Sidney, and so on. The reason
for this, as already intimated, is that sentiment and
imagination are generated, for the most part, in the
life of communication, and so belong with personal
images by original and necessary association, having
no separate existence except in our forms of speech.
The ideas that such words as modesty and magnanimity
stand for could never have been formed apart
from social intercourse, and indeed are nothing other
than remembered aspects of such intercourse. To
live this higher life, then, we must live with others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>by the aid of their visible presence, by reading their
words, or by recalling in imagination these or other
symbols of them. To lose our hold upon them—as,
for example, by long isolation or by the decay of the
imagination in disease or old age—is to lapse into a
life of sensation and crude instinct.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far as the study of immediate social relations is
concerned the personal idea is the real person. That
is to say, it is in this alone that one man exists for
another, and acts directly upon his mind. My association
with you evidently consists in the relation
between my idea of you and the rest of my mind. If
there is something in you that is wholly beyond this
and makes no impression upon me it has no social
reality in this relation. <em>The immediate social reality
is the personal idea</em>; nothing, it would seem, could be
much more obvious than this.</p>

<p class='c012'>Society, then, in its immediate aspect, <em>is a relation
among personal ideas</em>. In order to have society it is
evidently necessary that persons should get together
somewhere; and they get together only as personal
ideas in the mind. Where else? What other possible
<em>locus</em> can be assigned for the real contact of
persons, or in what other form can they come in contact
except as impressions or ideas formed in this
common <em>locus</em>? Society exists in my mind as the
contact and reciprocal influence of certain ideas
named “I,” Thomas, Henry, Susan, Bridget, and so
on. It exists in your mind as a similar group, and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>in every mind. Each person is immediately aware
of a particular aspect of society: and so far as he is
aware of great social wholes, like a nation or an
epoch, it is by embracing in this particular aspect
ideas or sentiments which he attributes to his countrymen
or contemporaries in their collective aspect.
In order to see this it seems to me only necessary to
discard vague modes of speech which have no conceptions
back of them that will bear scrutiny, and
look at the facts as we know them in experience.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet most of us, perhaps, will find it hard to assent
to the view that the social person is a group of sentiments
attached to some symbol or other characteristic
element, which keeps them together and from
which the whole idea is named. The reason for this
reluctance I take to be that we are accustomed to talk
and think, so far as we do think in this connection,
as if a person were a material rather than a psychical
fact. Instead of basing our sociology and ethics upon
what a man really is as part of our mental and moral
life, he is vaguely and yet grossly regarded as a
shadowy material body, a lump of flesh, and not as an
ideal thing at all. But surely it is only common-sense
to hold that the social and moral reality is that
which lives in our imaginations and affects our
motives. As regards the physical it is only the finer,
more plastic and mentally significant aspects of it
that imagination is concerned with, and with that
chiefly as a nucleus or centre of crystallization for
sentiment. Instead of perceiving this we commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>make the physical the dominant factor, and think of
the mental and moral only by a vague analogy to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Persons and society must, then, be studied primarily
in the imagination. It is surely true, <em>prima facie</em>,
that the best way of observing things is that which is
most direct; and I do not see how anyone can hold
that we know persons directly except as imaginative
ideas in the mind. These are perhaps the most vivid
things in our experience, and as observable as anything
else, though it is a kind of observation in which
accuracy has not been systematically cultivated. The
observation of the physical aspects, however important,
is for social purposes quite subsidiary: there is
no way of weighing or measuring men which throws
more than a very dim side-light on their personality.
The physical factors most significant are those elusive
traits of expression already discussed, and in the observation
and interpretation of these physical science
is only indirectly helpful. What, for instance, could
the most elaborate knowledge of his weights and
measures, including the anatomy of his brain, tell us
of the character of Napoleon? Not enough, I take
it, to distinguish him with certainty from an imbecile.
Our real knowledge of him is derived from reports of
his conversation and manner, from his legislation
and military dispositions, from the impression made
upon those about him and by them communicated to
us, from his portraits and the like; all serving as aids
to the imagination in forming a system that we call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>by his name. I by no means aim to discredit the
study of man or of society with the aid of physical
measurements, such as those of psychological laboratories;
but I think that these methods are indirect
and ancillary in their nature and are most useful when
employed in connection with a trained imagination.</p>

<p class='c012'>I conclude, therefore, that the imaginations which
people have of one another are the <em>solid facts</em> of society,
and that to observe and interpret these must be a
chief aim of sociology. I do not mean merely that society
must be studied <em>by</em> the imagination—that is true
of all investigations in their higher reaches—but that
the <em>object</em> of study is primarily an imaginative idea or
group of ideas in the mind, that we have to imagine
imaginations. The intimate grasp of any social fact
will be found to require that we divine what men
think of one another. Charity, for instance, is not
understood without imagining what ideas the giver
and recipient have of each other; to grasp homicide
we must, for one thing, conceive how the offender
thinks of his victim and of the administrators of the
law; the relation between the employing and hand-laboring
classes is first of all a matter of personal
attitudes which we must apprehend by sympathy
with both, and so on. In other words, we want to get
at motives, and motives spring from personal ideas.
There is nothing particularly novel in this view; historians,
for instance, have always assumed that to
understand and interpret personal relations was their
main business; but apparently the time is coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>when this will have to be done in a more systematic
and penetrating manner than in the past. Whatever
may justly be urged against the introduction of frivolous
and disconnected “personalities” into history,
the understanding of persons is the aim of this and all
other branches of social study.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is important to face the question of persons who
have no corporeal reality, as for instance the dead,
characters of fiction or the drama, ideas of the gods
and the like. Are these real people, members of
society? I should say that in so far as we imagine
them they are. Would it not be absurd to deny
social reality to Robert Louis Stevenson, who is so
much alive in many minds and so potently affects
important phases of thought and conduct? He is
certainly more real in this practical sense than most
of us who have not yet lost our corporeity, more alive,
perhaps, than he was before he lost his own, because
of his wider influence. And so Colonel Newcome, or
Romola, or Hamlet is real to the imaginative reader
with the realest kind of reality, the kind that works
directly upon his personal character. And the like is
true of the conceptions of supernatural beings handed
down by the aid of tradition among all peoples.
What, indeed, would society be, or what would any
one of us be, if we associated only with corporeal persons
and insisted that no one should enter our company
who could not show his power to tip the scales
and cast a shadow?</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>On the other hand, a corporeally existent person is
not socially real unless he is imagined. If the nobleman
thinks of the serf as a mere animal and does not
attribute to him a human way of thinking and feeling
the latter is not real to him in the sense of acting
personally upon his mind and conscience. And if a
man should go into a strange country and hide himself
so completely that no one knew he was there, he
would evidently have no social existence for the
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c012'>In saying this I hope I do not seem to question
the independent reality of persons or to confuse it
with personal ideas. The man is one thing and the
various ideas entertained about him are another; but
the latter, the personal idea, is the immediate social
reality, the thing in which men exist for one another,
and work directly upon one another’s lives. Thus
any study of society that is not supported by a firm
grasp of personal ideas is empty and dead—mere
doctrine and not knowledge at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>I believe that the vaguely material notion of personality,
which does not confront the social fact at
all but assumes it to be the analogue of the physical
fact, is a main source of fallacious thinking about
ethics, politics, and indeed every aspect of social and
personal life. It seems to underlie all four of the
ways of conceiving society and the individual alleged
in the first chapter to be false. If the person is
thought of primarily as a separate material form, inhabited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>by thoughts and feelings conceived by analogy
to be equally separate, then the only way of getting
a society is by adding on a new principle of
socialism, social faculty, altruism, or the like. But if
you start with the idea that the social person is primarily
a fact in the mind, and observe him there,
you find at once that he has no existence apart from
a mental whole of which all personal ideas are members,
and which is a particular aspect of society.
Every one of these ideas, as we have seen, is the outcome
of our experience of all the persons we have
known, and is only a special aspect of our general
idea of mankind.</p>

<p class='c012'>To many people it would seem mystical to say that
persons, as we know them, are not separable and
mutually exclusive, like physical bodies, so that what
is part of one cannot be part of another, but that
they interpenetrate one another, the same element
pertaining to different persons at different times, or
even at the same time: yet this is a verifiable and
not very abstruse fact.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The sentiments which
make up the largest and most vivid part of our idea
of any person are not, as a rule, peculiarly and exclusively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>his, but each one may be entertained in
conjunction with other persons also. It is, so to
speak, at the point of intersection of many personal
ideas, and may be reached through any one of them.
Not only Philip Sidney but many other people call
up the sentiment of honor, and likewise with kindness,
magnanimity, and so on. Perhaps these sentiments
are never precisely the same in any two
cases, but they are nearly enough alike to act in
about the same manner upon our motives, which is
the main thing from a practical point of view. Any
kindly face will arouse friendly feeling, any suffering
child awaken pity, any brave man inspire respect.
A sense of justice, of something being due to a man
as such, is potentially a part of the idea of every man
I know. All such feelings are a cumulative product
of social experience and do not belong exclusively to
any one personal symbol. A sentiment, if we consider
it as something in itself, is vaguely, indeterminately
personal; it may come to life, with only slight
variations, in connection with any one of many symbols;
whether it is referred to one or to another, or to
two or more at once, is determined by the way one’s
thoughts arrange themselves, by the connection in
which the sentiment is suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>As regards one’s self in relation to other people, I
shall have more to say in a later chapter; but I may
say here that there is no view of the self, that will
bear examination, which makes it altogether distinct,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>in our minds, from other persons. If it includes the
whole mind, then, of course, it includes all the persons
we think of, all the society which lives in our
thoughts. If we confine it to a certain part of our
thought with which we connect a distinctive emotion
or sentiment called self-feeling, as I prefer to do, it
still includes the persons with whom we feel most
identified. <em>Self and other do not exist as mutually
exclusive social facts</em>, and phraseology which implies
that they do, like the antithesis egoism <em>versus</em> altruism,
is open to the objection of vagueness, if not of
falsity.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> It seems to me that the classification of
impulses as altruistic and egoistic, with or without a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>third class called, perhaps, ego-altruistic, is empty;
and I do not see how any other conclusion can result
from a concrete study of the matter. There is no
class of altruistic impulses specifically different from
other impulses: all our higher, socially developed
sentiments are indeterminately personal, and may be
associated with self-feeling, or with whatever personal
symbol may happen to arouse them. Those feelings
which are merely sensual and have not been refined
into sentiments by communication and imagination
are not so much egoistic as merely animal: they do
not pertain to social persons, either first or second,
but belong in a lower stratum of thought. Sensuality
is not to be confused with the social self. As I shall
try to show later we do not think “I” except with
reference to a complementary thought of other persons;
it is an idea developed by association and
communication.</p>

<p class='c012'>The egoism-altruism way of speaking falsifies the
facts at the most vital point possible by assuming
that our impulses relating to persons are separable
into two classes, the I impulses and the You impulses,
in much the same way that physical persons are separable;
whereas a primary fact throughout the range
of sentiment is a fusion of persons, so that the impulse
belongs not to one or the other, but precisely
to the common ground that both occupy, to their intercourse
or mingling. Thus the sentiment of gratitude
does not pertain to me as against you, nor to
you as against me, but springs right from our union,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and so with all personal sentiment. Special terms
like egoism and altruism are presumably introduced
into moral discussions for the more accurate naming
of facts. But I cannot discover the facts for which
these are supposed to be names. The more I consider
the matter the more they appear to be mere
fictions of analogical thought. If you have no definite
idea of personality or self beyond the physical
idea you are naturally led to regard the higher phases
of thought, which have no evident relation to the
body, as in some way external to the first person or
self. Thus instead of psychology, sociology, or ethics
we have a mere shadow of physiology.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pity is typical of the impulses ordinarily called altruistic;
but if one thinks of the question closely it
is hard to see how this adjective is especially applicable
to it. Pity is not aroused exclusively by images
or symbols of other persons, as against those of one’s
self. If I think of my own body in a pitiable condition
I am perhaps as likely to feel pity as if I think
of someone else in such a condition.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> At any rate,
self-pity is much too common to be ignored. Even if
the sentiment were aroused only by symbols of other
persons it would not necessarily be non-egoistic. “A
father pitieth his children,” but any searching analysis
will show that he incorporates the children into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>his own imaginative self. And, finally, pity is not
necessarily moral or good, but is often mere “self-indulgence,”
as when it is practised at the expense of
justice and true sympathy. A “wounding pity,” to
use a phrase of Mr. Stevenson’s, is one of the commonest
forms of objectionable sentiment. In short,
pity is a sentiment like any other, having in itself no
determinate personality, as first or second, and no
determinate moral character: personal reference
and moral rank depend upon the conditions under
which it is suggested. The reason that it strikes us
as appropriate to call pity “altruistic” apparently is
that it often leads directly and obviously to helpful
practical activity, as toward the poor or the sick.
But “altruistic” is used to imply something more
than kindly or benevolent, some radical psychological
or moral distinction between this sentiment or class
of sentiments and others called egoistic, and this distinction
appears not to exist. All social sentiments
are altruistic in the sense that they involve reference
to another person; few are so in the sense that they
exclude the self. The idea of a division on this line
appears to flow from a vague presumption that personal
ideas must have a separateness answering to
that of material bodies.</p>

<p class='c012'>I do not mean to deny or depreciate the fact of
personal opposition; it is real and most important,
though it does not rest upon any such essential and,
as it were, material separateness as the common way
of thinking implies. At a given moment personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>symbols may stand for different and opposing tendencies;
thus the missionary may be urging me to
contribute to his cause, and, if he is skilful, the impulses
he awakens will move me in that direction;
but if I think of my wife and children and the summer
outing I had planned to give them from my
savings, an opposite impulse appears. And in all
such cases the very fact of opposition and the attention
thereby drawn to the conflicting impulses gives
emphasis to them, so that common elements are
overlooked and the persons in the imagination seem
separate and exclusive.</p>

<p class='c012'>In such cases, however, the harmonizing or moralizing
of the situation consists precisely in evoking or
appealing to the common element in the apparently
conflicting personalities, that is to some sentiment of
justice or right. Thus I may say to myself, “I can
afford a dollar, but ought not, out of consideration
for my family, to give more,” and may be able to
imagine all parties accepting this view of the case.</p>

<p class='c012'>Opposition between one’s self and someone else is
also a very real thing; but this opposition, instead
of coming from a separateness like that of material
bodies, is, on the contrary, dependent upon a measure
of community between one’s self and the disturbing
other, so that the hostility between one’s self and a
social person may always be described as hostile
sympathy. And the sentiments connected with opposition,
like resentment, pertain neither to myself,
considered separately, nor to the symbol of the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>person, but to ideas including both. I shall discuss
these matters at more length in subsequent chapters;
the main thing here is to note that personal opposition
does not involve mechanical separateness, but
arises from the emphasis of inconsistent elements in
ideas having much in common.</p>

<p class='c012'>The relations to one another and to the mind of the
various persons one thinks of might be rudely pictured
in some such way as this. Suppose we conceive
the mind as a vast wall covered with electric-light
bulbs, each of which represents a possible thought or
impulse whose presence in our consciousness may be
indicated by the lighting up of the bulb. Now each
of the persons we know is represented in such a
scheme, not by a particular area of the wall set apart
for him, but by a system of hidden connections among
the bulbs which causes certain combinations of them
to be lit up when his characteristic symbol is suggested.
If something presses the button corresponding
to my friend A, a peculiarly shaped figure appears
upon the wall; when that is released and B’s
button is pressed another figure appears, including
perhaps many of the same lights, yet unique as a
whole though not in its parts; and so on with as
many people as you please. It should also be considered
that we usually think of a person in relation
to some particular social situation, and that those
phases of him that bear on this situation are the only
ones vividly conceived. To recall someone is commonly
to imagine how this or that idea would strike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>him, what he would say or do in our place, and so
on. Accordingly, only some part, some appropriate
and characteristic part, of the whole figure that might
be lighted up in connection with a man’s symbol, is
actually illuminated.</p>

<p class='c012'>To introduce the self into this illustration we might
say that the lights near the centre of the wall were of
a particular color—say red—which faded, not too
abruptly, into white toward the edges. This red
would represent self-feeling, and other persons would
be more or less colored by it accordingly as they
were or were not intimately identified with our cherished
activities. In a mother’s mind, for instance,
her child would lie altogether in the inmost and
reddest area. Thus the same sentiment may belong
to the self and to several other persons at the same
time. If a man and his family are suffering from his
being thrown out of work his apprehension and resentment
will be part of his idea of each member of
his family, as well as part of his self-idea and of the
idea of people whom he thinks to blame.</p>

<p class='c012'>I trust it will be plain that there is nothing fantastic,
unreal, or impractical about this way of conceiving
people, that is by observing them as facts of
the imagination. On the contrary, the fantastic,
unreal, and practically pernicious way is the ordinary
and traditional one of speculating upon them as
shadowy bodies, without any real observation of
them as mental facts. It is the man as imagined
that we love or hate, imitate, or avoid, that helps or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>harms us, that moulds our wills and our careers.
What is it that makes a person real to us; is it
material contact or contact in the imagination?
Suppose, for instance, that on suddenly turning a
corner I collide with one coming from the opposite
direction: I receive a slight bruise, have the breath
knocked out of me, exchange conventional apologies,
and immediately forget the incident. It takes no
intimate hold upon me, means nothing except a slight
and temporary disturbance in the animal processes.
Now suppose, on the other hand, that I take up
Froude’s “Cæsar,” and presently find myself, under
the guidance of that skilful writer, imagining a hero
whose body long ago turned to clay. He is alive in
my thought: there is perhaps some notion of his
visible presence, and along with this the awakening
of sentiments of audacity, magnanimity and the like,
that glow with intense life, consume my energy, make
me resolve to be like Cæsar in some respect, and
cause me to see right and wrong and other great
questions as I conceive he would have seen them.
Very possibly he keeps me awake after I go to bed—every
boy has lain awake thinking of book people.
My whole after life will be considerably affected by
this experience, and yet this is a contact that takes
place only in the imagination. Even as regards the
physical organism it is immeasurably more important,
as a rule, than the material collision. A blow in the
face, if accidental and so not disturbing to the imagination,
affects the nerves, the heart, and the digestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>very little, but an injurious word or look may
cause sleepless nights, dyspepsia, or palpitation. It
is, then, the personal idea, the man in the imagination,
the real man of power and fruits, that we need
primarily to consider, and he appears to be somewhat
different from the rather conventional and material
man of traditionary social philosophy.</p>

<p class='c012'>According to this view of the matter society is
simply the collective aspect of personal thought.
Each man’s imagination, regarded as a mass of personal
impressions worked up into a living, growing
whole, is a special phase of society; and Mind or
Imagination as a whole, that is human thought considered
in the largest way as having a growth and
organization extending throughout the ages, is the
<em>locus</em> of society in the widest possible sense.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be objected that society in this sense has
no definite limits, but seems to include the whole
range of experience. That is to say, the mind is all
one growth, and we cannot draw any distinct line
between personal thought and other thought. There
is probably no such thing as an idea that is wholly
independent of minds other than that in which it
exists; through heredity, if not through communication,
all is connected with the general life, and so in
some sense social. What are spoken of above as
personal ideas are merely those in which the connection
with other persons is most direct and apparent.
This objection, however, applies to any way of defining
society, and those who take the material standpoint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>are obliged to consider whether houses, factories,
domestic animals, tilled land, and so on are not really
parts of the social order. The truth, of course, is
that all life hangs together in such a manner that
any attempt to delimit a part of it is artificial.
Society is rather a phase of life than a thing by
itself; it is life regarded from the point of view of
personal intercourse. And personal intercourse may
be considered either in its primary aspects, such as
are treated in this book, or in secondary aspects,
such as groups, institutions, or processes. Sociology,
I suppose, is the science of these things.</p>

</div>

of Human Life.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>The personal idea in its more penetrating interpretations
involves sympathy, in the sense of primary
communication or an entering into and sharing the
mind of someone else. When I converse with a man,
through words, looks, or other symbols, I have more
or less intelligence or <em>communion</em> with him, we get
on common ground and have similar ideas and sentiments.
If one uses sympathy in this connection—and
it is perhaps the most available word—one has to
bear in mind that it denotes the sharing of any mental
state that can be communicated, and has not the
special implication of pity or other “tender emotion”
that it very commonly carries in ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>speech.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> This emotionally colorless usage is, however,
perfectly legitimate, and is, I think, more common
in classical English literature than any other.
Thus Shakespeare, who uses sympathy five times, if
we may trust the “Shakespeare Phrase Book,” never
means by it the particular emotion of compassion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>but either the sharing of a mental state, as when he
speaks of “sympathy in choice,” or mere resemblance,
as when Iago mentions the lack of “sympathy in
years, manners and beauties” between Othello and
Desdemona. This latter sense is also one which
must be excluded in our use of the word, since what
is here meant is an active process of mental assimilation,
not mere likeness.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this chapter sympathy, in the sense of communion
or personal insight, will be considered chiefly
with a view to showing something of its nature as a
phase or member of the general life of mankind.</p>

<p class='c012'>The content of it, the matter communicated, is
chiefly thought and sentiment, in distinction from
mere sensation or crude emotion. I do not venture to
say that these latter cannot be shared, but certainly
they play a relatively small part in the communicative
life. Thus although to get one’s finger pinched is a
common experience, it is impossible, to me at least,
to recall the sensation when another person has his
finger pinched. So when we say that we feel sympathy
for a person who has a headache, we mean that
we pity him, not that we share the headache. There
is little true communication of physical pain, or anything
of that simple sort. The reason appears to be
that as ideas of this kind are due to mere physical
contacts, or other simple stimuli, in the first instance,
they are and remain detached and isolated in the
mind, so that they are unlikely to be recalled except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>by some sensation of the sort originally associated
with them. If they become objects of thought and
conversation, as is likely to be the case when they are
agreeable, they are by that very process refined into
sentiments. Thus when the pleasures of the table are
discussed the thing communicated is hardly the sensation
of taste but something much subtler, although
partly based upon that. Thought and sentiment are
from the first parts or aspects of highly complex and
imaginative personal ideas, and of course may be
reached by anything which recalls any part of those
ideas. They are aroused by personal intercourse because
in their origin they are connected with personal
symbols. The sharing of a sentiment ordinarily
comes to pass by our perceiving one of these symbols
or traits of expression which has belonged with the
sentiment in the past and now brings it back. And
likewise with thought: it is communicated by words,
and these are freighted with the net result of centuries
of intercourse. Both spring from the general life
of society and cannot be separated from that life,
nor it from them.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not to be inferred that we must go through
the same visible and tangible experiences as other
people before we can sympathize with them. On the
contrary, there is only an indirect and uncertain connection
between one’s sympathies and the obvious
events—such as the death of friends, success or failure
in business, travels, and the like—that one has
gone through. Social experience is a matter of imaginative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>not of material, contacts; and there are so
many aids to the imagination that little can be
judged as to one’s experience by the merely external
course of his life. An imaginative student of a few
people and of books often has many times the range
of comprehension that the most varied career can
give to a duller mind; and a man of genius, like
Shakespeare, may cover almost the whole range of
human sentiment in his time, not by miracle, but by
a marvellous vigor and refinement of imagination.
The idea that seeing life means going from place to
place and doing a great variety of obvious things is
an illusion natural to dull minds.</p>

<p class='c011'>One’s range of sympathy is a measure of his personality,
indicating how much or how little of a man
he is. It is in no way a special faculty, but a function
of the whole mind to which every special faculty
contributes, so that what a person is and what he
can understand or enter into through the life of
others, are very much the same thing. We often
hear people described as sympathetic who have little
mental power, but are of a sensitive, impressionable,
quickly responsive type of mind. The sympathy of
such a mind always has some defect corresponding
to its lack of character and of constructive force.
A strong, deep understanding of other people implies
mental energy and stability; it is a work of
persistent, cumulative imagination which may be associated
with a comparative slowness of direct sensibility.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>On the other hand, we often see the
union of a quick sensitiveness to immediate impressions
with an inability to comprehend what
has to be reached by reason or constructive imagination.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sympathy is a requisite to social power. Only in
so far as a man understands other people and thus
enters into the life around him has he any effective
existence; the less he has of this the more he is a
mere animal, not truly in contact with human life.
And if he is not in contact with it he can of course
have no power over it. This is a principle of familiar
application, and yet one that is often overlooked,
practical men having, perhaps, a better grasp of it
than theorists. It is well understood by men of the
world that effectiveness depends at least as much
upon address, <em>savoir faire</em>, tact, and the like, involving
sympathetic insight into the minds of other people,
as upon any more particular faculties. There is
nothing more practical than social imagination; to
lack it is to lack everything. All classes of persons
need it—the mechanic, the farmer, and the tradesman,
as well as the lawyer, the clergyman, the railway president,
the politician, the philanthropist, and the poet.
Every year thousands of young men are preferred to
other thousands and given positions of more responsibility
largely because they are seen to have a power of
personal insight which promises efficiency and growth.
Without “calibre,” which means chiefly a good imagination,
there is no getting on much in the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The strong men of our society, however much we
may disapprove of the particular direction in which
their sympathy is sometimes developed, or the ends
their power is made to serve, are very human men,
not at all the abnormal creatures they are sometimes
asserted to be. I have met a fair number of such
men, and they have generally appeared, each in his
own way, to be persons of a certain scope and
breadth that marked them off from the majority.</p>

<p class='c012'>A person of definite character and purpose, who
comprehends our way of thought, is sure to exert power
over us. He cannot altogether be resisted; because,
if he understands us, he can make us understand him,
through the word, the look, or other symbol, which
both of us connect with the common sentiment or
idea; and thus by communicating an impulse he can
move the will. Sympathetic influence enters into
our system of thought as a matter of course, and affects
our conduct as surely as water affects the
growth of a plant. The kindred spirit can turn on
a system of lights, to recur to the image of the last
chapter, and so transform the mental illumination.
This is the nature of all authority and leadership,
as I shall try to explain more fully in another
chapter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again, sympathy, in the broad sense in which it is
here used, underlies also the moral rank of a man and
goes to fix our estimate of his justice and goodness.
The just, the good, or the right under any name, is of
course not a thing by itself, but is a finer product
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>wrought up out of the various impulses that life affords,
and colored by them. Hence no one can think
and act in a way that strikes us as right unless he feels,
in great part, the same impulses that we do. If he
shares the feelings that seem to us to have the best
claims, it naturally follows, if he is a person of stable
character, that he does them justice in thought and action.
To be upright, public-spirited, patriotic, charitable,
generous, and just implies that a man has a broad
personality which feels the urgency of sympathetic or
imaginative motives that in narrower minds are weak
or lacking. He has achieved the higher sentiments,
the wider range of personal thought. And so far as
we see in his conduct that he feels such motives and
that they enter into his decisions, we are likely to call
him good. What is it to do good, in the ordinary
sense? Is it not to help people to enjoy and to work,
to fulfil the healthy and happy tendencies of human
nature; to give play to children, education to youth,
a career to men, a household to women, and peace to
old age? And it is sympathy that makes a man wish
and need to do these things. One who is large
enough to live the life of the race will feel the impulses
of each class as his own, and do what he can
to gratify them as naturally as he eats his dinner.
The idea that goodness is something apart from ordinary
human nature is pernicious; it is only an
ampler expression of that nature.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, all badness, injustice, or wrong
is, in one of its aspects, a lack of sympathy. If a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>man’s action is injurious to interests which other men
value, and so impresses them as wrong, it must be
because, at the moment of action, he does not feel
those interests as they do. Accordingly the wrong-doer
is either a person whose sympathies do not embrace
the claims he wrongs, or one who lacks sufficient
stability of character to express his sympathies in
action. A liar, for instance, is either one who does
not feel strongly the dishonor, injustice, and confusion
of lying, or one who, feeling them at times, does not
retain the feeling in decisive moments. And so a
brutal person may be such either in a dull or chronic
way, which does not know the gentler sentiments at
any time, or in a sudden and passionate way which
perhaps alternates with kindness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Much the same may be said regarding mental
health in general; its presence or absence may always
be expressed in terms of sympathy. The test
of sanity which everyone instinctively applies is that
of a certain tact or feeling of the social situation,
which we expect of all right-minded people and which
flows from sympathetic contact with other minds.
One whose words and bearing give the impression
that he stands apart and lacks intuition of what
others are thinking is judged as more or less absentminded,
queer, dull, or even insane or imbecile, according
to the character and permanence of the phenomenon.
The essence of insanity, from the social
point of view (and, it would seem, the only final test
of it) is a confirmed lack of touch with other minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>in matters upon which men in general are agreed;
and imbecility might be defined as a general failure
to compass the more complex sympathies.</p>

<p class='c011'>A man’s sympathies as a whole reflect the social
order in which he lives, or rather they are a particular
phase of it. Every group of which he is really a
member, in which he has any vital share, must live
in his sympathy; so that his mind is a microcosm of
so much of society as he truly belongs to. Every
social phenomenon, we need to remember, is simply
a collective view of what we find distributively in
particular persons—public opinion is a phase of the
judgments of individuals; traditions and institutions
live in the thought of particular men, social standards
of right do not exist apart from private consciences,
and so on. Accordingly, so far as a man has any
vital part in the life of a time or a country that life
is imaged in those personal ideas or sympathies
which are the impress of his intercourse.</p>

<p class='c012'>So, whatever is peculiar to our own time, implies
a corresponding peculiarity in the sympathetic life
of each one of us. Thus the age, at least in the
more intellectually active parts of life, is strenuous,
characterized by the multiplication of points of personal
contact through enlarged and accelerated communication.
The mental aspect of this is a more
rapid and multitudinous flow of personal images,
sentiments, and impulses. Accordingly there prevails
among us an animation of thought that tends to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>lift men above sensuality; and there is also possible
a choice of relations that opens to each mind a more
varied and congenial development than the past afforded.
On the other hand, these advantages are not
without their cost; the intensity of life often becomes
a strain, bringing to many persons an overexcitation
which weakens or breaks down character;
as we see in the increase of suicide and insanity,
and in many similar phenomena. An effect very
generally produced upon all except the strongest
minds appears to be a sort of superficiality of imagination,
a dissipation and attenuation of impulses,
which watches the stream of personal imagery go by
like a procession, but lacks the power to organize
and direct it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The different degrees of urgency in personal impressions
are reflected in the behavior of different
classes of people. Everyone must have noticed that
he finds more real openness of sympathy in the country
than in the city—though perhaps there is more
of a superficial readiness in the latter—and often
more among plain, hand-working people than among
professional and business men. The main reason for
this, I take it, is that the social imagination is not so
hard worked in the one case as in the other. In the
mountains of North Carolina the hospitable inhabitants
will take in any stranger and invite him to
spend the night; but this is hardly possible upon
Broadway; and the case is very much the same with
the hospitality of the mind. If one sees few people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and hears a new thing only once a week, he accumulates
a fund of sociability and curiosity very favorable
to eager intercourse; but if he is assailed all day and
every day by calls upon feeling and thought in excess
of his power to respond, he soon finds that he must
put up some sort of a barrier. Sensitive people who
live where life is insistent take on a sort of social
shell whose function is to deal mechanically with ordinary
relations and preserve the interior from destruction.
They are likely to acquire a conventional
smile and conventional phrases for polite intercourse,
and a cold mask for curiosity, hostility, or solicitation.
In fact, a vigorous power of resistance to the
numerous influences that in no way make for the
substantial development of his character, but rather
tend to distract and demoralize him, is a primary
need of one who lives in the more active portions of
present society, and the loss of this power by strain
is in countless instances the beginning of mental and
moral decline. There are times of abounding energy
when we exclaim with Schiller,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="de">Seid willkommen, Millionen,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Diesen Kuss der ganzen Welt!</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>but it is hardly possible or desirable to maintain this
attitude continuously. Universal sympathy is impracticable;
what we need is better control and selection,
avoiding both the narrowness of our class and
the dissipation of promiscuous impressions. It is
well for a man to open out and take in as much of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>life as he can organize into a consistent whole, but to
go beyond that is not desirable. In a time of insistent
suggestion, like the present, it is fully as important
to many of us to know when and how to restrict
the impulses of sympathy as it is to avoid narrowness.
And this is in no way inconsistent, I think, with that
modern democracy of sentiment—also connected with
the enlargement of communication—which deprecates
the limitation of sympathy by wealth or position.
Sympathy must be selective, but the less it
is controlled by conventional and external circumstances,
such as wealth, and the more it penetrates
to the essentials, of character, the better. It is this
liberation from convention, locality, and chance, I
think, that the spirit of the time calls for.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again, the life of this age is more diversified than
life ever was before, and this appears in the mind of
the person who shares it as a greater variety of interests
and affiliations. A man may be regarded as the
point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles
representing social groups, having as many arcs passing
through him as there are groups. This diversity
is connected with the growth of communication, and is
another phase of the general enlargement and variegation
of life. Because of the greater variety of
imaginative contacts it is impossible for a normally
open-minded individual not to lead a broader life, in
some respects at least, than he would have led in
the past. Why is it, for instance, that such ideas as
brotherhood and the sentiment of equal right are now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>so generally extended to all classes of men? Primarily,
I think, because all classes have become imaginable,
by acquiring power and means of expression.
He whom I imagine without antipathy becomes my
brother. If we feel that we must give aid to another,
it is because that other lives and strives in our imaginations,
and so is a part of ourselves. The shallow
separation of self and other in common speech obscures
the extreme simplicity and naturalness of such
feelings. If I come to imagine a person suffering
wrong it is not “altruism” that makes me wish to
right that wrong, but simple human impulse. He is
my life, as really and immediately as anything else.
His symbol arouses a sentiment which is no more his
than mine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus we lead a wider life; and yet it is also true
that there is demanded of us a more distinct specialization
than has been required in the past. The complexity
of society takes the form of organization, that
is of a growing unity and breadth sustained by the co-operation
of differentiated parts, and the man of the
age must reflect both the unity and the differentiation;
he must be more distinctly a specialist and at the
same time more a man of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>It seems to many a puzzling question whether, on
the whole, the breadth or the specialization is more
potent in the action of modern life upon the individual;
and by insisting on one aspect or the other it is
easy to frame an argument to show either that personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>life is becoming richer, or that man is getting
to be a mere cog in a machine.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> I think, however,
that these two tendencies are not really opposite but
complementary; that it is not a case of breadth <em>versus</em>
specialization, but, in the long run at least, of breadth
<em>plus</em> specialization to produce a richer and more
various humanity. There are many evils connected
with the sudden growth in our day of new social
structures, and the subjection of a part of the people
to a narrow and deadening routine is one of them, but
I think that a healthy specialization has no tendency
to bring this about. On the contrary, it is part of a
liberating development. The narrow specialist is a
bad specialist; and we shall learn that it is a mistake
to produce him.</p>

<p class='c012'>In an organized life isolation cannot succeed, and
a right specialization does not isolate. There is no
such separation between special and general knowledge
or efficiency as is sometimes supposed. In
what does the larger knowledge of particulars consist,
if not in perceiving their relation to wholes? Has a
student less general knowledge because he is familiar
with a specialty, or is it not rather true that in so far
as he knows one thing well it is a window through
which he sees things in general?</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>There is no way to penetrate the surface of life but
by attacking it earnestly at a particular point. If one
takes his stand in a field of corn when the young
plants have begun to sprout, all the plants in the field
will appear to be arranged in a system of rows radiating
from his feet; and no matter where he stands
the system will appear to centre at that point. It is
so with any standpoint in the field of thought and intercourse;
to possess it is to have a point of vantage
from which the whole may, in a particular manner, be
apprehended. It is surely a matter of common observation
that a man who knows no one thing intimately
has no views worth hearing on things in general.
The farmer philosophizes in terms of crops,
soils, markets, and implements, the mechanic generalizes
his experience of wood and iron, the seaman
reaches similar conclusions by his own special road;
and if the scholar keeps pace with these it must be
by an equally virile productivity. It is a common
opinion that breadth of culture is a thing by itself, to
be imparted by a particular sort of studies, as, for
instance, the classics, modern languages, and so on.
And there is a certain practical truth in this, owing,
I think, to the fact that certain studies are taught in
a broad or cultural way, while others are not. But
the right theory of the matter is that speciality and
culture are simply aspects of the same healthy mental
growth, and that any study is cultural when taught
in the best way. And so the humblest careers in life
may involve culture and breadth of view, if the incumbent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>is trained, as he should be, to feel their
larger relations.</p>

<p class='c012'>A certain sort of writers often assume that it is the
tendency of our modern specialized production to
stunt the mind of the workman by a meaningless routine;
but fair opportunities of observation and some
practical acquaintance with machinery and the men
who use it lead me to think that this is not the <em>general</em>
fact. On the contrary, it is precisely the broad
or cultural traits of general intelligence, self-reliance,
and adaptability that make a man at home and efficient
in the midst of modern machinery, and it is
because the American workman has these traits in a
comparatively high degree that he surpasses others
in the most highly specialized production. One who
goes into our shops will find that the intelligent and
adaptive workman is almost always preferred and
gets higher wages; and if there are large numbers
employed upon deadening routine it is partly because
there is unfortunately a part of our population whose
education makes them unfit for anything else. The
type of mechanic which a complex industrial system
requires, and which it is even now, on the whole,
evolving, is one that combines an intimate knowledge
of particular tools and processes with an intelligent
apprehension of the system in which he works. If he
lacks the latter he requires constant oversight and so
becomes a nuisance. Anyone acquainted with such
matters knows that “gumption” in workmen is fully
as important and much harder to find than mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>manual skill; and that those who possess it are usually
given superior positions. During the late war with
Spain it became obvious that the complicated machinery
of a modern warship is ineffectual without intelligent,
self-reliant, and determined “men behind the
guns” to work it; and, of course, the same holds true
of other kinds of machinery. And if we pass from
tools to personal relations we shall find that the
specialized production so much deprecated is only
one phase of a wider general life, a life of comparative
freedom, intelligence, education, and opportunity,
whose general effect is to enlarge the individual. No
doubt there are cases in which intelligence seems to
have passed out of the man into the machine, leaving
the former a mere “tender”; but I think these are
not representative of the change as a whole.</p>

<p class='c012'>The idea of a necessary antagonism between specialization
and breadth seems to me an illusion of
the same class as that which opposes the individual
to the social order. First one aspect and then another
is looked at in artificial isolation, and it is not
perceived that we are beholding but one thing, after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not only does the sympathetic life of a man reflect
and imply the <em>state</em> of society, but we may also
discern in it some inkling of those processes, or principles
of change, that we see at large in the general
movement of mankind. This is a matter rather beyond
the scope of this book; but a few illustrations
will show, in a general way, what I mean.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The act of sympathy follows the general law that
nature works onward by mixing like and unlike, continuity
and change; and so illustrates the same principle
that we see in the mingling of heredity with
variation, specific resemblance with a differentiation
of sexes and of individuals, tradition with discussion,
inherited social position with competition, and so
on. The likeness in the communicating persons is
necessary for comprehension, the difference for interest.
We cannot feel strongly toward the totally
unlike because it is unimaginable, unrealizable; nor
yet toward the wholly like because it is stale—identity
must always be dull company. The power of
other natures over us lies in a stimulating difference
which causes excitement and opens communication,
in ideas similar to our own but not identical, in
states of mind attainable but not actual. If one has
energy he soon wearies of any habitual round of activities
and feelings, and his organism, competent to
a larger life, suffers pains of excess and want at the
same time. The key to the situation is another person
who can start a new circle of activities and give
the faculties concerned with the old a chance to rest.
As Emerson has remarked, we come into society to
be played upon. “Friendship,” he says again, “requires
that rare mean betwixt likeness and unlikeness,
that piques each with the presence of power
and of consent in the other party.... Let him
not cease an instant to be himself. The only joy I
have in his being mine is that the <em>not mine</em> is <em>mine</em>....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>There must be very two before there can
be very one.”<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> So Goethe, speaking of Spinoza’s attraction
for him, remarks that the closest unions rest
on contrast;<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> and it is well known that such a contrast
was the basis of his union with Schiller, “whose
character and life,” he says, “were in complete contrast
to my own.”<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Of course, some sorts of sympathy
are especially active in their tendency, like
the sympathy of vigorous boys with soldiers and sea-captains;
while others are comparatively quiet, like
those of old people renewing common memories. It
is vivid and elastic where the tendency to growth is
strong, reaching out toward the new, the onward, the
mysterious; while old persons, the under-vitalized
and the relaxed or wearied prefer a mild sociability,
a comfortable companionship in habit; but even
with the latter there must always be a stimulus
given, something new suggested or something forgotten
recalled, not merely a resemblance of thought
but a “resembling difference.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And sympathy between man and woman, while it
is very much complicated with the special instinct of
sex, draws its life from this same mixture of mental
likeness and difference. The love of the sexes is
above all a need, a need of new life which only the
other can unlock.</p>

<p class='c017'>says the princess in Tasso; and this appears to express
a general principle. Each sex represents to the
other a wide range of fresh and vital experience inaccessible
alone. Thus the woman usually stands for
a richer and more open emotional life, the man for a
stronger mental grasp, for control and synthesis.
Alfred without Laura feels dull, narrow, and coarse,
while Laura on her part feels selfish and hysterical.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, sympathy is selective, and thus illustrates a
phase of the vital process more talked about at present
than any other. To go out into the life of other
people takes energy, as everyone may see in his own
experience; and since energy is limited and requires
some special stimulus to evoke it, sympathy becomes
active only when our imaginations are reaching out
after something we admire or love, or in some way
feel the need to understand and make our own. A
healthy mind, at least, does not spend much energy on
things that do not, in some way, contribute to its development:
ideas and persons that lie wholly aside
from the direction of its growth, or from which it has
absorbed all they have to give, necessarily lack interest
for it and so fail to awaken sympathy. An incontinent
response to every suggestion offered indicates
the breaking down of that power of inhibition or refusal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>that is our natural defence against the reception
of material we cannot digest, and looks toward weakness,
instability, and mental decay. So with persons
from whom we have nothing to gain, in any sense,
whom we do not admire, or love, or fear, or hate, and
who do not even interest us as psychological problems
or objects of charity, we can have no sympathy
except of the most superficial and fleeting sort. I
do not overlook the fact that a large class of people
suffer a loss of human breadth and power by falling
into a narrow and exclusive habit of mind; but at the
same time personality is nothing unless it has character,
individuality, a distinctive line of growth, and
to have this is to have a principle of rejection as well
as reception in sympathy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Social development as a whole, and every act of
sympathy as a part of that development, is guided
and stimulated in its selective growth by feeling.
The outgoing of the mind into the thought of another
is always, it would seem, an excursion in search of
the congenial; not necessarily of the pleasant, in the
ordinary sense, but of that which is fitting or congruous
with our actual state of feeling. Thus we
would not call Carlyle or the Book of Job pleasant
exactly, yet we have moods in which these writers,
however lacking in amenity, seem harmonious and
attractive.</p>

<p class='c012'>In fact, our mental life, individual and collective, is
truly a never finished work of art, in the sense that
we are ever striving, with such energy and materials
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>as we possess, to make of it a harmonious and congenial
whole. Each man does this in his own peculiar
way, and men in the aggregate do it for human
nature at large, each individual contributing to the
general endeavor. There is a tendency to judge
every new influence, as the painter judges every
fresh stroke of his brush, by its relation to the
whole achieved or in contemplation, and to call it
good or ill according to whether it does or does not
make for a congruous development. We do this for
the most part instinctively, that is, without deliberate
reasoning; something of the whole past, hereditary
and social, lives in our present state of mind, and
welcomes or rejects the suggestions of the moment.
There is always some profound reason for the eagerness
that certain influences arouse in us, through
which they tap our energy and draw us in their
direction, so that we cling to and augment them,
growing more and more in their sense. Thus if one
likes a book, so that he feels himself inclined to take
it down from time to time and linger in the companionship
of the author, he may be sure he is getting
something that he needs, though it may be long
before he discovers what it is. It is quite evident
that there must be, in every phase of mental life, an
æsthetic impulse to preside over selection.</p>

<p class='c011'>In common thought and speech sympathy and love
are closely connected; and in fact, as most frequently
used, they mean somewhat the same thing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the sympathy ordinarily understood being an affectionate
sympathy, and the love a sympathetic affection.
I have already suggested that sympathy is
not dependent upon any particular emotion, but
may, for instance, be hostile as well as friendly;
and it might also be shown that affection, though
it stimulates sympathy and so usually goes with it,
is not inseparable from it, but may exist in the absence
of the mental development which true sympathy
requires. Whoever has visited an institution
for the care of idiots and imbeciles must have been
struck by the exuberance with which the milk of
human kindness seems to flow from the hearts of
these creatures. If kept quiet and otherwise properly
cared for they are mostly as amiable as could be
wished, fully as much so, apparently, as persons of
normal development; while at the same time they
offer little or no resistance to other impulses, such as
rage and fear, that sometimes possess them. Kindliness
seems to exist primarily as an animal instinct, so
deeply rooted that mental degeneracy, which works
from the top down, does not destroy it until the mind
sinks to the lower grades of idiocy.</p>

<p class='c012'>However, the excitant of love, in all its finer
aspects, is a felt possibility of communication, a
dawning of sympathetic renewal. We grow by influence,
and where we feel the presence of an influence
that is enlarging or uplifting, we begin to love. Love
is the normal and usual accompaniment of the
healthy expansion of human nature by communion;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>and in turn is the stimulus to more communion. It
seems not to be a special emotion in quite the same
way that anger, grief, fear, and the like are, but
something more primary and general, the stream,
perhaps, of which these and many other sentiments
are special channels or eddies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Love and sympathy, then, are two things which,
though distinguishable, are very commonly found
together, each being an instigator of the other; what
we love we sympathize with, so far as our mental
development permits. To be sure, it is also true that
when we hate a person, with an intimate, imaginative,
human hatred, we enter into his mind, or sympathize—any
strong interest will arouse the imagination and
create some sort of sympathy—but affection is a more
usual stimulus.</p>

<p class='c012'>Love, in this sense of kindly sympathy, may have
all degrees of emotional intensity and of sympathetic
penetration, from a sort of passive good-nature, not
involving imagination or mental activity of any sort,
up to an all-containing human enthusiasm, involving
the fullest action of the highest faculties, and bringing
with it so strong a conviction of complete good
that the best minds have felt and taught that God is
Love. Thus understood it is not any specific sort of
emotion, at least not that alone, but a general outflowing
of the mind and heart, accompanied by that
gladness that the fullest life carries with it. When
the apostle John says that God is love, and that
everyone that loveth knoweth God, he evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>means something more than personal affection, something
that knows as well as feels, that takes account
of all special aspects of life and is just to all.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ordinary personal affection does not fill our ideal
of right or justice, but encroaches, like all special impulses.
It is not at all uncommon to wrong one person
out of affection for another. If, for instance, I
am able to procure a desirable position for a friend,
it may well happen that there is another and a fitter
man, whom I do not know or do not care for, from
whose point of view my action is an injurious abuse
of power. It is evident that good can be identified
with no simple emotion, but must be sought
in some wider phase of life that embraces all points
of view. So far as love approaches this comprehensiveness
it tends toward justice, because the claims
of all live and are adjusted in the mind of him who
has it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Love’s hearts are faithful but not fond,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bound for the just but not beyond.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus love of a large and symmetrical sort, not merely
a narrow tenderness, implies justice and right, since
a mind that has the breadth and insight to feel this
will be sure to work out magnanimous principles of
conduct.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is in some such sense as this, as an expansion of
human nature into a wider life, that I can best understand
the use of the word love in the writings of certain
great teachers, for instance in such passages as
the following:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“What is Love, and why is it the chief good, but because
it is an overpowering enthusiasm.... He who
is in love is wise and is becoming wiser, sees newly every
time he looks at the object beloved, drawing from it
with his eyes and his mind those virtues which it possesses.”<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>“A great thing is love, ever a great good; which alone
makes light all the heavy and bears equally every inequality.
For its burden is not a burden, and it makes
every bitter sweet and savory.... Love would be
arisen, not held down by anything base. Love would be
free, and alienated from every worldly affection, that its
intimate desire may not be hindered, that it may not become
entangled through any temporal good fortune, nor
fall through any ill. There is nothing sweeter than love,
nothing braver, nothing higher, nothing broader, nothing
joyfuller, nothing fuller or better in heaven or on earth,
since love is born of God, nor can rest save in God above all
created things.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He that loves, flies, runs, and is joyful; is free and not
restrained. He gives all for all and has all in all, since he
is at rest above all in the one highest good from which
every good flows and proceeds. He regards not gifts, but
beyond all good things turns to the giver. Love oft knows
not the manner, but its heat is more than every manner.
Love feels no burden, regards not labors, strives toward
more than it attains, argues not of impossibility, since it
believes that it may and can all things. Therefore it avails
for all things, and fulfils and accomplishes much where
one not a lover falls and lies helpless.”<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The sense of joy, of freshness, of youth, and of the
indifference of circumstances, that comes with love,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>seems to be connected with its receptive, outgoing
nature. It is the fullest life, and when we have it
we feel happy because our faculties are richly employed;
young because reception is the essence of
youth, and indifferent to conditions because we feel
by our present experience that welfare is independent
of them. It is when we have lost our hold upon this
sort of happiness that we begin to be anxious about
security and comfort, and to take a distrustful and
pessimistic attitude toward the world in general.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the literature of the feelings we often find that
love and self are set over against each other, as by
Tennyson when he says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Love took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with might;</div>
      <div class='line'>Smote the chord of self, that, trembling, passed in music out of sight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Let us consider for a moment whether, or in what
sense, this antithesis is a just one.</p>

<p class='c012'>As regards its relation to self we may, perhaps,
distinguish two kinds of love, one of which is mingled
with self-feeling and the other is not. The latter is a
disinterested, contemplative joy, in feeling which the
mind loses all sense of its private existence; while the
former is active, purposeful, and appropriate, rejoicing
in its object with a sense of being one with it
as against the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>In so far as one feels the disinterested love, that
which has no designs with reference to its object, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>has no sense of “I” at all, but simply exists in something
to which he feels no bounds. Of this sort, for
instance, seem to be the delight in natural beauty, in
the landscape and the shining sea, the joy and rest of
art—so long as we have no thought of production or
criticism—and the admiration of persons regarding
whom we have no intentions, either of influence or
imitation. It appears to be the final perfection of
this unspecialized joy that the Buddhist sages seek
in Nirvana. Love of this sort obliterates that idea
of separate personality whose life is always unsure
and often painful. One who feels it leaves the precarious
self; his boat glides out upon a wider stream;
he forgets his own deformity, weakness, shame or
failure, or if he thinks of them it is to feel free of
them, released from their coil. No matter what you
and I may be, if we can comprehend that which is
fair and great we may still have it, may transcend
ourselves and go out into it. It carries us beyond
the sense of all individuality, either our own or
others’, into the feeling of universal and joyous
life. The “I,” the specialized self, and the passions
involved with it, have a great and necessary part to
play, but they afford no continuing city; they are so
evidently transient and insecure that the idealizing
mind cannot rest in them, and is glad to forget them
at times and to go out into a life joyous and without
bounds in which thought may be at peace.</p>

<p class='c012'>But love that plans and strives is always in some
degree self-love. That is, self-feeling is correlated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>with individualized, purposeful thought and action,
and so begins to spring up as soon as love lingers upon
something, forms intentions and begins to act. The
love of a mother for her child is appropriative, as is
apparent from the fact that it is capable of jealousy.
Its characteristic is not selflessness, by any means,
but the association of self-feeling with the idea of
<em>her</em> child. It is no more selfless in its nature than
the ambitions of a man, and may or may not be
morally superior; the idea that it involves self-abnegation
seems to spring from the crudely material
notion of personality which assumes that other persons
are external to the self. And so of all productive,
specialized love. I shall say more of the self in the
next chapter, but my belief is that it is impossible to
cherish and strive for special purposes without having
self-feeling about them; without becoming more
or less capable of resentment, pride, and fear regarding
them. The imaginative and sympathetic aims
that are commonly spoken of as self-renunciation are
more properly an enlargement of the self, and by no
means destroy, though they may transform, the “I.”
A wholly selfless love is mere contemplation, an
escape from conscious speciality, and a dwelling in
undifferentiated life. It sees all things as one and
makes no effort.</p>

<p class='c012'>These two sorts of love are properly complementary,
one corresponding to production and giving
each of us a specialized intensity and effectiveness,
while in the other we find enlargement and relief.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>They are indeed closely bound together and each
contributory to the other. The self and the special
love that goes with it seem to grow by a sort of
crystallization about them of elements from the wider
life. The man first loves the woman as something
transcendent, divine, or universal, which he dares not
think of appropriating; but presently he begins to
claim her as <em>his</em> in antithesis to the rest of the world,
and to have hopes, fears, and resentments regarding
her; the painter loves beauty contemplatively, and
then tries to paint it; the poet delights in his visions,
and then tries to tell them, and so on. It is
necessary to our growth that we should be capable
of delighting in that upon which we have no designs,
because we draw our fresh materials from this region.
The sort of self-love that is harmful is one
that has hardened about a particular object and
ceased to expand. On the other hand, it seems that
the power to enter into universal life depends upon
a healthy development of the special self. “Willst
du in’s Unendliche schreiten,” said Goethe, “geh
nur im Endlichen nach allen Seiten.” That which
we have achieved by special, selfful endeavor becomes
a basis of inference and sympathy, which
gives a wider reach to our disinterested contemplation.
While the artist is trying to paint he forfeits
the pure joy of contemplation; he is strenuous, anxious,
vain, or mortified; but when he ceases trying he
will be capable, just because of this experience, of a
fuller appreciation of beauty in general than he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>before. And so of personal affection; the winning
of wife, home, and children involves constant self-assertion,
but it multiplies the power of sympathy.
We cannot, then, exalt one of these over the other;
what would seem desirable is that the self, without
losing its special purpose and vigor, should keep expanding,
so that it should tend to include more and
more of what is largest and highest in the general
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears, then, that sympathy, in the sense of
mental sharing or communication, is by no means a
simple matter, but that so much enters into it as to
suggest that by the time we thoroughly understood
one sympathetic experience we should be in a way
to understand the social order itself. An act of
communication is a particular aspect of the whole
which we call society, and necessarily reflects that of
which it is a characteristic part. To come into touch
with a friend, a leader, an antagonist, or a book, is
an act of sympathy; but it is precisely in the totality
of such acts that society consists. Even the most
complex and rigid institutions may be looked upon
as consisting of innumerable personal influences or
acts of sympathy, organized, in the case of institutions,
into a definite and continuing whole by means
of some system of permanent symbols, such as laws,
constitutions, sacred writings, and the like, in which
personal influences are preserved. And, turning the
matter around, we may look upon every act of sympathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>as a particular expression of the history, institutions,
and tendencies of the society in which it
takes place. Every influence which you or I can
receive or impart will be characteristic of the race,
the country, the epoch, in which our personalities
have grown up.</p>

<p class='c012'>The main thing here is to bring out the <em>vital</em> unity
of every phase of personal life, from the simplest interchange
of a friendly word to the polity of nations
or of hierarchies. The common idea of the matter
is crudely mechanical—that there are persons as
there are bricks and societies as there are walls. A
person, or some trait of personality or of intercourse,
is held to be the element of society, and the latter is
formed by the aggregation of these elements. Now
there is no such thing as an element of society in the
sense that a brick is the element of a wall; this is
a mechanical conception quite inapplicable to vital
phenomena. I should say that living wholes have
aspects but not elements.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Capitoline Museum at Rome is a famous
statue of Venus, which, like many works of this kind,
is ingeniously mounted upon a pivot, so that one
who wishes to study it can place it at any angle with
reference to the light that he may prefer. Thus he
may get an indefinite number of views, but in every
view what he really observes, so far as he observes
intelligently, is the whole statue in a particular aspect.
Even if he fixes his attention upon the foot,
or the great toe, he sees this part, if he sees it rightly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>in relation to the work as a whole. And it seems
to me that the study of human life is analogous in
character. It is expedient to divide it into manageable
parts in some way; but this division can only
be a matter of aspects, not of elements. The various
chapters of this book, for instance, do not deal
with separable subjects, but merely with phases of a
common subject, and the same is true of any work
in psychology, history or biology.</p>

</div>

Relation to the Body—As a Sense of Power or Causation—As

in Relation to Sex—Simplicity and Affectation—Social
Self-feeling is Universal.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>It is well to say at the outset that by the word
“self” in this discussion is meant simply that which
is designated in common speech by the pronouns of
the first person singular, “I,” “me,” “my,” “mine,”
and “myself.” “Self” and “ego” are used by
metaphysicians and moralists in many other senses,
more or less remote from the “I” of daily speech
and thought, and with these I wish to have as little
to do as possible. What is here discussed is what psychologists
call the empirical self, the self that can be
apprehended or verified by ordinary observation. I
qualify it by the word social not as implying the existence
of a self that is not social—for I think that
the “I” of common language always has more or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>less distinct reference to other people as well as the
speaker—but because I wish to emphasize and dwell
upon the social aspect of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although the topic of the self is regarded as an
abstruse one this abstruseness belongs chiefly, perhaps,
to the metaphysical discussion of the “pure
ego”—whatever that may be—while the empirical
self should not be very much more difficult to get
hold of than other facts of the mind. At any rate, it
may be assumed that the pronouns of the first person
have a substantial, important, and not very recondite
meaning, otherwise they would not be in constant and
intelligible use by simple people and young children
the world over. And since they have such a meaning
why should it not be observed and reflected upon like
any other matter of fact? As to the underlying mystery,
it is no doubt real, important, and a very fit subject
of discussion by those who are competent, but I
do not see that it is a <em>peculiar</em> mystery. I mean that
it seems to be simply a phase of the general mystery
of life, not pertaining to “I” more than to any other
personal or social fact; so that here as elsewhere
those who are not attempting to penetrate the mystery
may simply ignore it. If this is a just view of
the matter, “I” is merely a fact like any other.</p>

<p class='c011'>The distinctive thing in the idea for which the pronouns
of the first person are names is apparently a
characteristic kind of feeling which may be called
the my-feeling or sense of appropriation. Almost any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>sort of ideas may be associated with this feeling, and
so come to be named “I” or “mine,” but the feeling,
and that alone it would seem, is the determining factor
in the matter. As Professor James says in his
admirable discussion of the self, the words “me”
and “self” designate “all the things which have the
power to produce in a stream of consciousness excitement
of a certain peculiar sort.”<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> This view is very
fully set forth by Professor Hiram M. Stanley, whose
work, “The Evolutionary Psychology of Feeling,” has
an extremely suggestive chapter on self-feeling.</p>

<p class='c012'>I do not mean that the feeling aspect of the self is
necessarily more important than any other, but that
it is the immediate and decisive sign and proof of
what “I” is; there is no appeal from it; if we go
behind it it must be to study its history and conditions,
not to question its authority. But, of course,
this study of history and conditions may be quite as
profitable as the direct contemplation of self-feeling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>What I would wish to do is to present each aspect in
its proper light.</p>

<p class='c012'>The emotion or feeling of self may be regarded as
an instinct, doubtless evolved in connection with its
important function in stimulating and unifying the
special activities of individuals.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> It is thus very profoundly
rooted in the history of the human race and
apparently indispensable to any plan of life at all
similar to ours. It seems to exist in a vague though
vigorous form at the birth of each individual, and,
like other instinctive ideas or germs of ideas, to be
defined and developed by experience, becoming associated,
or rather incorporated, with muscular, visual and
other sensations; with perceptions, apperceptions and
conceptions of every degree of complexity and of infinite
variety of content; and, especially, with personal
ideas. Meantime the feeling itself does not remain
unaltered, but undergoes differentiation and refinement
just as does any other sort of crude innate feeling.
Thus, while retaining under every phase its characteristic
tone or flavor, it breaks up into innumerable
self-sentiments. And concrete self-feeling, as it exists
in mature persons, is a whole made up of these various
sentiments, along with a good deal of primitive
emotion not thus broken up. It partakes fully of the
general development of the mind, but never loses that
peculiar gusto of appropriation that causes us to name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>a thought with a first-personal pronoun. The other
contents of the self-idea are of little use, apparently,
in defining it, because they are so extremely various.
It would be no more futile, it seems to me, to attempt
to define fear by enumerating the things that people
are afraid of, than to attempt to define “I” by enumerating
the objects with which the word is associated.
Very much as fear means primarily a state of
feeling, or its expression, and not darkness, fire, lions,
snakes, or other things that excite it, so “I” means
primarily self-feeling, or its expression, and not body,
clothes, treasures, ambition, honors, and the like, with
which this feeling may be connected. In either case
it is possible and useful to go behind the feeling and
enquire what ideas arouse it and why they do so, but
this is in a sense a secondary investigation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since “I” is known to our experience primarily
as a feeling, or as a feeling-ingredient in our ideas,
it cannot be described or defined without suggesting
that feeling. We are sometimes likely to fall into a
formal and empty way of talking regarding questions
of emotion, by attempting to define that which is in
its nature primary and indefinable. A formal definition
of self-feeling, or indeed of any sort of feeling,
must be as hollow as a formal definition of the taste
of salt, or the color red; we can expect to know
what it is only by experiencing it. There can be no
final test of the self except the way we feel; it is
that toward which we have the “my” attitude. But
as this feeling is quite as familiar to us and as easy to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>recall as the taste of salt or the color red, there
should be no difficulty in understanding what is
meant by it. One need only imagine some attack on
his “me,” say ridicule of his dress or an attempt to
take away his property or his child, or his good name
by slander, and self-feeling immediately appears. Indeed,
he need only pronounce, with strong emphasis,
one of the self-words, like “I” or “my,” and self-feeling
will be recalled by association. Another good
way is to enter by sympathy into some self-assertive
state of mind depicted in literature; as, for instance,
into that of Coriolanus when, having been sneered at
as a “boy of tears,” he cries out:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“Boy!...</div>
      <div class='line'>If you have writ your annals true, ’tis there,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I</div>
      <div class='line'>Fluttered your Volscians in Corioli;</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone I did it.—Boy!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Here is a self indeed, which no one can fail to feel,
though he might be unable to describe it. What a
ferocious scream of the outraged ego is that “I” at
the end of the second line!</p>

<p class='c012'>So much is written on this topic that ignores self-feeling
and thus deprives “self” of all vivid and palpable
meaning, that I feel it permissible to add a few
more passages in which this feeling is forcibly expressed.
Thus in Lowell’s poem, “A Glance Behind
the Curtain,” Cromwell says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“I, perchance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Am one raised up by the Almighty arm</div>
      <div class='line'>To witness some great truth to all the world.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>And his Columbus, on the bow of his vessel, soliloquizes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here am I, with no friend but the sad sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>The beating heart of this great enterprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, without me, would stiffen in swift death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And so the “I am the way” which we read in the
New Testament is surely the expression of a sentiment
not very different from these. In the following
we have a more plaintive sentiment of self:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt><em>Philoctetes.</em>—</dt>
    <dd>And know’st thou not, O boy, whom thou dost see?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Neoptolemus.</em>—</dt>
    <dd>How can I know a man I ne’er beheld?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Philoctetes.</em>—</dt>
    <dd>And didst thou never hear my name, nor fame
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Of these my ills, in which I pined away?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Neoptolemus.</em>—</dt>
    <dd>Know that I nothing know of what thou ask’st.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Philoctetes.</em>—</dt>
    <dd>O crushed with many woes, and of the Gods
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Hated am I, of whom, in this my woe,
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>No rumor travelled homeward, nor went forth
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Through any clime of Hellas.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' style='text-decoration: none; 
    '><sup>[39]</sup></a>
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c012'>We all have thoughts of the same sort as these,
and yet it is possible to talk so coldly or mystically
about the self that one begins to forget that there is,
really, any such thing.</p>

<p class='c012'>But perhaps the best way to realize the naïve
meaning of “I” is to listen to the talk of children
playing together, especially if they do not agree very
well. They use the first person with none of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>conventional self-repression of their elders, but with
much emphasis and variety of inflection, so that its
emotional animus is unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c012'>Self-feeling of a reflective and agreeable sort, an
appropriative zest of contemplation, is strongly suggested
by the word “gloating.” To gloat, in this sense,
is as much as to think “mine, mine, mine,” with a
pleasant warmth of feeling. Thus a boy gloats over
something he has made with his scroll-saw, over the
bird he has brought down with his gun, or over his
collection of stamps or eggs; a girl gloats over her
new clothes, and over the approving words or looks
of others; a farmer over his fields and his stock; a
business man over his trade and his bank account;
a mother over her child; the poet over a successful
quatrain; the self-righteous man over the state of
his soul; and in like manner everyone gloats over
the prosperity of any cherished idea.</p>

<p class='c012'>I would not be understood as saying that self-feeling
is clearly marked off in experience from other
kinds of feeling; but it is, perhaps, as definite in
this regard as anger, fear, grief, and the like. To
quote Professor James, “The emotions themselves
of self-satisfaction and abasement are of a unique
sort, each as worthy to be classed as a primitive
emotional species as are, for example, rage or pain.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
It is true here, as wherever mental facts are distinguished,
that there are no fences, but that one thing
merges by degrees into another. Yet if “I” did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>denote an idea much the same in all minds and fairly
distinguishable from other ideas, it could not be used
freely and universally as a means of communication.</p>

<p class='c011'>As many people have the impression that the verifiable
self, the object that we name with “I,” is
usually the material body, it may be well to say
that this impression is an illusion, easily dispelled
by anyone who will undertake a simple examination
of facts. It is true that when we philosophize
a little about “I” and look around for a
tangible object to which to attach it, we soon fix
upon the material body as the most available <em>locus</em>;
but when we use the word naïvely, as in ordinary
speech, it is not very common to think of the body
in connection with it; not nearly so common as it is
to think of other things. There is no difficulty in
testing this statement, since the word “I” is one of
the commonest in conversation and literature, so that
nothing is more practicable than to study its meaning
at any length that may be desired. One need
only listen to ordinary speech until the word has occurred,
say, a hundred times, noting its connections,
or observe its use in a similar number of cases by the
characters in a novel. Ordinarily it will be found
that in not more than ten cases in a hundred does
“I” have reference to the body of the person speaking.
It refers chiefly to opinions, purposes, desires,
claims, and the like, concerning matters that involve
no thought of the body. <em>I</em> think or feel so and so;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span><em>I</em> wish or intend so and so; <em>I</em> want this or that; are
typical uses, the self-feeling being associated with
the view, purpose, or object mentioned. It should
also be remembered that “my” and “mine” are as
much the names of the self as “I” and these, of
course, commonly refer to miscellaneous possessions.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had the curiosity to attempt a rough classification
of the first hundred “I’s” and “me’s” in
Hamlet, with the following results. The pronoun was
used in connection with perception, as “I hear,” “I
see,” fourteen times; with thought, sentiment, intention,
etc., thirty-two times; with wish, as “I pray
you,” six times; as speaking—“I’ll speak to it”—sixteen
times; as spoken to, twelve times; in connection
with action, involving perhaps some vague notion
of the body, as “I came to Denmark,” nine times;
vague or doubtful, ten times; as equivalent to bodily
appearance—“No more like my father than I to
Hercules”—once. Some of the classifications are
arbitrary, and another observer would doubtless get
a different result; but he could not fail, I think, to
conclude that Shakespeare’s characters are seldom
thinking of their bodies when they say “I” or “me.”
And in this respect they appear to be representative
of mankind in general.</p>

<p class='c011'>As already suggested, instinctive self-feeling is
doubtless connected in evolution with its important
function in stimulating and unifying the special activities
of individuals. It appears to be associated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>chiefly with ideas of the exercise of power, of being a
cause, ideas that emphasize the antithesis between
the mind and the rest of the world. The first definite
thoughts that a child associates with self-feeling
are probably those of his earliest endeavors to control
visible objects—his limbs, his playthings, his
bottle, and the like. Then he attempts to control
the actions of the persons about him, and so his circle
of power and of self-feeling widens without interruption
to the most complex objects of mature ambition.
Although he does not say “I” or “my”
during the first year or two, yet he expresses so
clearly by his actions the feeling that adults associate
with these words that we cannot deny him a self
even in the first weeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>The correlation of self-feeling with purposeful activity
is easily seen by observing the course of any
productive enterprise. If a boy sets about making a
boat, and has any success, his interest in the matter
waxes, he gloats over it, the keel and stern are dear
to his heart, and its ribs are more to him than those
of his own frame. He is eager to call in his friends
and acquaintances, saying to them, “See what I am
doing! Is it not remarkable?”, feeling elated when
it is praised, and resentful or humiliated when fault
is found with it. But so soon as he finishes it and
turns to something else, his self-feeling begins to
fade away from it, and in a few weeks at most he
will have become comparatively indifferent. We all
know that much the same course of feeling accompanies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the achievements of adults. It is impossible
to produce a picture, a poem, an essay, a difficult bit
of masonry, or any other work of art or craft, without
having self-feeling regarding it, amounting usually to
considerable excitement and desire for some sort of
appreciation; but this rapidly diminishes with the
activity itself, and often lapses into indifference after
it ceases.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may perhaps be objected that the sense of self,
instead of being limited to times of activity and definite
purpose, is often most conspicuous when the
mind is unoccupied or undecided, and that the idle and
ineffectual are commonly the most sensitive in their
self-esteem. This, however, may be regarded as an
instance of the principle that all instincts are likely
to assume troublesome forms when denied wholesome
expression. The need to exert power, when
thwarted in the open fields of life, is the more likely
to assert itself in trifles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The social self is simply any idea, or system
of ideas, drawn from the communicative life, that
the mind cherishes as its own. Self-feeling has
its chief scope <em>within</em> the general life, not outside
of it, the special endeavor or tendency of
which it is the emotional aspect finding its principal
field of exercise in a world of personal forces,
reflected in the mind by a world of personal impressions.</p>

<p class='c012'>As connected with the thought of other persons it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>is always a consciousness of the peculiar or differentiated
aspect of one’s life, because that is the aspect
that has to be sustained by purpose and endeavor,
and its more aggressive forms tend to attach themselves
to whatever one finds to be at once congenial
to one’s own tendencies and at variance with those of
others with whom one is in mental contact. It is
here that they are most needed to serve their function
of stimulating characteristic activity, of fostering
those personal variations which the general plan
of life seems to require. Heaven, says Shakespeare,
doth divide</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The state of man in divers functions,</div>
      <div class='line'>Setting endeavor in continual motion,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and self-feeling is one of the means by which this
diversity is achieved.</p>

<p class='c012'>Agreeably to this view we find that the aggressive
self manifests itself most conspicuously in an appropriativeness
of objects of common desire, corresponding
to the individual’s need of power over such
objects to secure his own peculiar development, and
to the danger of opposition from others who also need
them. And this extends from material objects to lay
hold, in the same spirit, of the attentions and affections
of other people, of all sorts of plans and ambitions,
including the noblest special purposes the
mind can entertain, and indeed of any conceivable
idea which may come to seem a part of one’s life
and in need of assertion against someone else. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>attempt to limit the word self and its derivatives
to the lower aims of personality is quite arbitrary;
at variance with common-sense as expressed by the
emphatic use of “I” in connection with the sense of
duty and other high motives, and unphilosophical as
ignoring the function of the self as the organ of specialized
endeavor of higher as well as lower kinds.</p>

<p class='c012'>That the “I” of common speech has a meaning
which includes some sort of reference to other persons
is involved in the very fact that the word and
the ideas it stands for are phenomena of language
and the communicative life. It is doubtful whether
it is possible to use language at all without thinking
more or less distinctly of someone else, and certainly
the things to which we give names and which
have a large place in reflective thought are almost
always those which are impressed upon us by our
contact with other people. Where there is no communication
there can be no nomenclature and no
developed thought. What we call “me,” “mine,” or
“myself” is, then, not something separate from the
general life, but the most interesting part of it, a part
whose interest arises from the very fact that it is both
general and individual. That is, we care for it just
because it is that phase of the mind that is living and
striving in the common life, trying to impress itself
upon the minds of others. “I” is a militant
social tendency, working to hold and enlarge its place
in the general current of tendencies. So far as it can
it waxes, as all life does. To think of it as apart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>from society is a palpable absurdity of which no one
could be guilty who really <em>saw</em> it as a fact of life.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="de">Der Mensch erkennt sich nur im Menschen, nur</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Das Leben lehret jedem was er sei.</span>”<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>If a thing has no relation to others of which one
is conscious he is unlikely to think of it at all, and if
he does think of it he cannot, it seems to me, regard
it as emphatically <em>his</em>. The appropriative sense is
always the shadow, as it were, of the common life,
and when we have it we have a sense of the latter in
connection with it. Thus, if we think of a secluded
part of the woods as “ours,” it is because we think,
also, that others do not go there. As regards the
body I doubt if we have a vivid my-feeling about any
part of it which is not thought of, however vaguely,
as having some actual or possible reference to someone
else. Intense self-consciousness regarding it
arises along with instincts or experiences which connect
it with the thought of others. Internal organs,
like the liver, are not thought of as peculiarly ours
unless we are trying to communicate something regarding
them, as, for instance, when they are giving
us trouble and we are trying to get sympathy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I,” then, is not all of the mind, but a peculiarly
central, vigorous, and well-knit portion of it, not separate
from the rest but gradually merging into it,
and yet having a certain practical distinctness, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>that a man generally shows clearly enough by his
language and behavior what his “I” is as distinguished
from thoughts he does not appropriate. It
may be thought of, as already suggested, under the
analogy of a central colored area on a lighted wall.
It might also, and perhaps more justly, be compared
to the nucleus of a living cell, not altogether separate
from the surrounding matter, out of which indeed it
is formed, but more active and definitely organized.</p>

<p class='c012'>The reference to other persons involved in the
sense of self may be distinct and particular, as when
a boy is ashamed to have his mother catch him at
something she has forbidden, or it may be vague and
general, as when one is ashamed to do something
which only his conscience, expressing his sense of
social responsibility, detects and disapproves; but it
is always there. There is no sense of “I,” as in
pride or shame, without its correlative sense of you,
or he, or they. Even the miser gloating over his
hidden gold can feel the “mine” only as he is aware
of the world of men over whom he has secret power;
and the case is very similar with all kinds of hid
treasure. Many painters, sculptors, and writers have
loved to withhold their work from the world, fondling
it in seclusion until they were quite done with
it; but the delight in this, as in all secrets, depends
upon a sense of the value of what is concealed.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a very large and interesting class of cases the
social reference takes the form of a somewhat definite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>imagination of how one’s self—that is any idea
he appropriates—appears in a particular mind, and
the kind of self-feeling one has is determined by the
attitude toward this attributed to that other mind.
A social self of this sort might be called the reflected
or looking-glass self:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Each to each a looking-glass</div>
      <div class='line'>Reflects the other that doth pass.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>As we see our face, figure, and dress in the glass, and
are interested in them because they are ours, and
pleased or otherwise with them according as they do
or do not answer to what we should like them to be;
so in imagination we perceive in another’s mind
some thought of our appearance, manners, aims,
deeds, character, friends, and so on, and are variously
affected by it.</p>

<p class='c012'>A self-idea of this sort seems to have three principal
elements: the imagination of our appearance to
the other person; the imagination of his judgment of
that appearance, and some sort of self-feeling, such as
pride or mortification. The comparison with a looking-glass
hardly suggests the second element, the imagined
judgment, which is quite essential. The thing
that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere
mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed
sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon
another’s mind. This is evident from the fact that
the character and weight of that other, in whose
mind we see ourselves, makes all the difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>with our feeling. We are ashamed to seem evasive
in the presence of a straightforward man, cowardly
in the presence of a brave one, gross in the eyes
of a refined one, and so on. We always imagine,
and in imagining share, the judgments of the other
mind. A man will boast to one person of an action—say
some sharp transaction in trade—which he
would be ashamed to own to another.</p>

<p class='c011'>It should be evident that the ideas that are associated
with self-feeling and form the intellectual content
of the self cannot be covered by any simple description,
as by saying that the body has such a part
in it, friends such a part, plans so much, etc., but
will vary indefinitely with particular temperaments
and environments. The tendency of the self, like
every aspect of personality, is expressive of far-reaching
hereditary and social factors, and is not to be understood
or predicted except in connection with the
general life. Although special, it is in no way separate—speciality
and separateness are not only different
but contradictory, since the former implies connection
with a whole. The object of self-feeling is
affected by the general course of history, by the particular
development of nations, classes, and professions,
and other conditions of this sort.</p>

<p class='c012'>The truth of this is perhaps most decisively shown
in the fact that even those ideas that are most generally
associated or colored with the “my” feeling, such
as one’s idea of his visible person, of his name, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>family, his intimate friends, his property, and so on,
are not universally so associated, but may be separated
from the self by peculiar social conditions. Thus the
ascetics, who have played so large a part in the history
of Christianity and of other religions and philosophies,
endeavored not without success to divorce their
appropriative thought from all material surroundings,
and especially from their physical persons, which they
sought to look upon as accidental and degrading circumstances
of the soul’s earthly sojourn. In thus
estranging themselves from their bodies, from property
and comfort, from domestic affections—whether
of wife or child, mother, brother or sister—and from
other common objects of ambition, they certainly
gave a singular direction to self-feeling, but they
did not destroy it: there can be no doubt that the
instinct, which seems imperishable so long as mental
vigor endures, found other ideas to which to attach
itself; and the strange and uncouth forms which
ambition took in those centuries when the solitary,
filthy, idle, and sense-tormenting anchorite was a
widely accepted ideal of human life, are a matter of
instructive study and reflection. Even in the highest
exponents of the ascetic ideal, like St. Jerome,
it is easy to see that the discipline, far from effacing
the self, only concentrated its energy in lofty and
unusual channels. The self-idea may be that of
some great moral reform, of a religious creed, of the
destiny of one’s soul after death, or even a cherished
conception of the deity. Thus devout writers, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>George Herbert and Thomas à Kempis, often address
<em>my</em> God, not at all conventionally as I conceive the
matter, but with an intimate sense of appropriation.
And it has been observed that the demand for the
continued and separate existence of the individual
soul after death is an expression of self-feeling, as by
J. A. Symonds, who thinks that it is connected with
the intense egotism and personality of the European
races, and asserts that the millions of Buddhism
shrink from it with horror.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Habit and familiarity are not of themselves sufficient
to cause an idea to be appropriated into the
self. Many habits and familiar objects that have
been forced upon us by circumstances rather than
chosen for their congeniality remain external and possibly
repulsive to the self; and, on the other hand,
a novel but very congenial element in experience, like
the idea of a new toy, or, if you please, Romeo’s idea
of Juliet, is often appropriated almost immediately,
and becomes, for the time at least, the very heart of
the self. Habit has the same fixing and consolidating
action in the growth of the self that it has elsewhere,
but is not its distinctive characteristic.</p>

<p class='c011'>As suggested in the previous chapter, self-feeling
may be regarded as in a sense the antithesis, or better
perhaps, the complement, of that disinterested and
contemplative love that tends to obliterate the sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of a divergent individuality. Love of this sort has no
sense of bounds, but is what we feel when we are expanding
and assimilating new and indeterminate experience,
while self-feeling accompanies the appropriating,
delimiting, and defending of a certain part of
experience; the one impels us to receive life, the
other to individuate it. The self, from this point
of view, might be regarded as a sort of citadel of the
mind, fortified without and containing selected treasures
within, while love is an undivided share in the
rest of the universe. In a healthy mind each contributes
to the growth of the other: what we love intensely
or for a long time we are likely to bring within
the citadel, and to assert as part of ourself. On the
other hand, it is only on the basis of a substantial
self that a person is capable of progressive sympathy
or love.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sickness of either is to lack the support of the
other. There is no health in a mind except as it
keeps expanding, taking in fresh life, feeling love and
enthusiasm; and so long as it does this its self-feeling
is likely to be modest and generous; since these sentiments
accompany that sense of the large and the
superior which love implies. But if love closes, the
self contracts and hardens: the mind having nothing
else to occupy its attention and give it that change
and renewal it requires, busies itself more and more
with self-feeling, which takes on narrow and disgusting
forms, like avarice, arrogance, and fatuity.
It is necessary that we should have self-feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>about a matter during its conception and execution;
but when it is accomplished or has failed the self
ought to break loose and escape, renewing its skin
like the snake, as Thoreau says. No matter what a
man does, he is not fully sane or human unless there
is a spirit of freedom in him, a soul unconfined by
purpose and larger than the practicable world. And
this is really what those mean who inculcate the suppression
of the self; they mean that its rigidity must
be broken up by growth and renewal, that it must be
more or less decisively “born again.” A healthy,
self must be both vigorous and plastic, a nucleus of
solid, well-knit private purpose and feeling, guided
and nourished by sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The view that “self” and the pronouns of the first
person are names which the race has learned to apply
to an instinctive attitude of mind, and which each
child in turn learns to apply in a similar way, was
impressed upon me by observing my child M. at the
time when she was learning to use these pronouns.
When she was two years and two weeks old I was
surprised to discover that she had a clear notion of
the first and second persons when used possessively.
When asked, “Where is your nose?” she would put
her hand upon it and say “my.” She also understood
that when someone else said “my” and touched
an object, it meant something opposite to what was
meant when she touched the same object and used
the same word. Now, anyone who will exercise his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>imagination upon the question how this matter must
appear to a mind having no means of knowing anything
about “I” and “my” except what it learns by
hearing them used, will see that it should be very
puzzling. Unlike other words, the personal pronouns
have, apparently, no uniform meaning, but convey
different and even opposite ideas when employed by
different persons. It seems remarkable that children
should master the problem before they arrive at considerable
power of abstract reasoning. How should
a little girl of two, not particularly reflective, have
discovered that “my” was not the sign of a definite
object like other words, but meant something different
with each person who used it? And, still more
surprising, how should she have achieved the correct
use of it with reference to herself which, it would
seem, <em>could not be copied from anyone else</em>, simply
because no one else used it to describe what belonged
to her? The meaning of words is learned by
associating them with other phenomena. But how is
it possible to learn the meaning of one which, as used
by others, is never associated with the same phenomenon
as when properly used by one’s self? Watching
her use of the first person, I was at once struck
with the fact that she employed it almost wholly in a
possessive sense, and that, too, when in an aggressive,
self-assertive mood. It was extremely common to
see R. tugging at one end of a plaything and M.
at the other, screaming, “My, my.” “Me” was
sometimes nearly equivalent to “my,” and was also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>employed to call attention to herself when she wanted
something done for her. Another common use of
“my” was to demand something she did not have at
all. Thus if R. had something the like of which she
wanted, say a cart, she would exclaim, “Where’s <em>my</em>
cart?”</p>

<p class='c012'>It seemed to me that she might have learned the
use of these pronouns about as follows. The self-feeling
had always been there. From the first week
she had wanted things and cried and fought for them.
She had also become familiar by observation and
opposition with similar appropriative activities on
the part of R. Thus she not only had the feeling
herself, but by associating it with its visible expression
had probably divined it, sympathized with it,
resented it, in others. Grasping, tugging, and screaming
would be associated with the feeling in her own
case and would recall the feeling when observed in
others. They would constitute a language, precedent
to the use of first-personal pronouns, to express the
self-idea. All was ready, then, for the word to name
this experience. She now observed that R., when
contentiously appropriating something, frequently
exclaimed, “<em>my</em>,” “<em>mine</em>,” “give it to <em>me</em>,” “<em>I</em> want
it,” and the like. Nothing more natural, then, than
that she should adopt these words as names for a
frequent and vivid experience with which she was
already familiar in her own case and had learned to
attribute to others. Accordingly it appeared to me,
as I recorded in my notes at the time, that “‘my’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>‘mine’ are simply names for concrete images of appropriativeness,”
embracing both the appropriative
feeling and its manifestation. If this is true the child
does not at first work out the I-and-you idea in an
abstract form. The first-personal pronoun is a sign
of a concrete thing after all, but that thing is not
primarily the child’s body, or his muscular sensations
as such, but the phenomenon of aggressive
appropriation, practised by himself, witnessed in
others, and incited and interpreted by a hereditary
instinct. This seems to get over the difficulty above
mentioned, namely, the seeming lack of a common
content between the meaning of “my” when used by
another and when used by one’s self. This common
content is found in the appropriative feeling and the
visible and audible signs of that feeling. An element
of difference and strife comes in, of course, in
the opposite actions or purposes which the “my”
of another and one’s own “my” are likely to stand
for. When another person says “mine” regarding
something which I claim, I sympathize with him
enough to understand what he means, but it is a
hostile sympathy, overpowered by another and more
vivid “mine” connected with the idea of drawing the
object my way.</p>

<p class='c012'>In other words, the meaning of “I” and “mine”
is learned in the same way that the meanings of
hope, regret, chagrin, disgust, and thousands of other
words of emotion and sentiment are learned: that is,
by having the feeling, imputing it to others in connection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>with some kind of expression, and hearing
the word along with it. As to its communication
and growth the self-idea is in no way peculiar that I
see, but essentially like other ideas. In its more
complex forms, such as are expressed by “I” in conversation
and literature, it is a social sentiment,
or type of sentiments, defined and developed by intercourse,
in the manner suggested in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p class='c012'>R., though a more reflective child than M., was
much slower in understanding these pronouns, and
in his thirty-fifth month had not yet straightened
them out, sometimes calling his father “me.” I imagine
that this was partly because he was placid
and uncontentious in his earliest years, manifesting
little social self-feeling, but chiefly occupied with impersonal
experiment and reflection; and partly because
he saw little of other children by antithesis to whom
his self could be awakened. M., on the other hand,
coming later, had R.’s opposition on which to whet
her naturally keen appropriativeness. And her society
had a marked effect in developing self-feeling
in R., who found self-assertion necessary to preserve
his playthings, or anything else capable of appropriation.
He learned the use of “my,” however,
when he was about three years old, before M. was
born. He doubtless acquired it in his dealings with
his parents. Thus he would perhaps notice his
mother claiming the scissors as <em>mine</em> and seizing
upon them, and would be moved sympathetically to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>claim something in the same way—connecting the
word with the act and the feeling rather than the
object. But as I had not the problem clearly in
mind at that time I made no satisfactory observations.</p>

<p class='c012'>I imagine, then, that as a rule the child associates
“I” and “me” at first only with those ideas regarding
which his appropriative feeling is aroused and
defined by opposition. He appropriates his nose,
eye, or foot in very much the same way as a plaything—by
antithesis to other noses, eyes, and feet,
which he cannot control. It is not uncommon to
tease little children by proposing to take away one
of these organs, and they behave precisely as if
the “mine” threatened were a separable object—which
it might be for all they know. And, as I have
suggested, even in adult life, “I,” “me,” and “mine”
are applied with a strong sense of their meaning
only to things distinguished as peculiar to us by
some sort of opposition or contrast. They always
imply social life and relation to other persons. That
which is most distinctively mine is very private, it
is true, but it is that part of the private which I am
cherishing in antithesis to the rest of the world, not
the separate but the special. The aggressive self is
essentially a militant phase of the mind, having for
its apparent function the energizing of peculiar activities,
and although the militancy may not go on in
an obvious, external manner, it always exists as a
mental attitude.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>In some of the best-known discussions of the development
of the sense of self in children the chief
emphasis has been placed upon the speculative or
quasi-metaphysical ideas concerning “I” which children
sometimes formulate as a result either of questions
from their elders, or of the independent
development of a speculative instinct. The most
obvious result of these inquiries is to show that a
child, when he reflects upon the self in this manner,
usually locates “I” in the body. Interesting and important
as this juvenile metaphysics is, as one phase
of mental development, it should certainly not be
taken as an adequate expression of the childish sense
of self, and probably President G. Stanley Hall, who
has collected valuable material of this kind, does
not so take it.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> This analysis of the “I,” asking
one’s self just where it is located, whether particular
limbs are embraced in it, and the like, is somewhat
remote from the ordinary, naïve use of the word, with
children as with grown people. In my own children
I only once observed anything of this sort, and that
was in the case of R., when he was struggling to
achieve the correct use of his pronouns; and a futile,
and as I now think mistaken, attempt was made to
help him by pointing out the association of the word
with his body. On the other hand, every child who
has learned to talk uses “I,” “me,” “mine,” and the
like hundreds of times a day, with great emphasis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>in the simple, naïve way that the race has used them
for thousands of years. In this usage they refer to
claims upon playthings, to assertions of one’s peculiar
will or purpose, as “<em>I</em> don’t want to do it that
way,” “<em>I</em> am going to draw a kitty,” and so on,
rarely to any part of the body. And when a part of
the body is meant it is usually by way of claiming
approval for it, as “Don’t I look nice?” so that the
object of chief interest is after all another person’s
attitude. The speculative “I,” though a true “I,” is
not the “I” of common speech and workaday usefulness,
but almost as remote from ordinary thought as
the ego of metaphysicians, of which, indeed, it is an
immature example.</p>

<p class='c012'>That children, when in this philosophizing state
of mind, usually refer “I” to the physical body, is
easily explained by the fact that their materialism,
natural to all crude speculation, needs to locate the
self somewhere, and the body, the one tangible thing
over which they have continuous power, seems the
most available home for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The process by which self-feeling of the looking-glass
sort develops in children may be followed
without much difficulty. Studying the movements of
others as closely as they do they soon see a connection
between their own acts and changes in those
movements; that is, they perceive their own influence
or power over persons. The child appropriates the
visible actions of his parent or nurse, over which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>finds he has some control, in quite the same way as
he appropriates one of his own members or a plaything,
and he will try to do things with this new
possession, just as he will with his hand or his rattle.
A girl six months old will attempt in the most
evident and deliberate manner to attract attention
to herself, to set going by her actions some of those
movements of other persons that she has appropriated.
She has tasted the joy of being a cause, of
exerting social power, and wishes more of it. She
will tug at her mother’s skirts, wriggle, gurgle,
stretch out her arms, etc., all the time watching for
the hoped-for effect. These performances often give
the child, even at this age, an appearance of what is
called affectation, that is she seems to be unduly
preoccupied with what other people think of her.
Affectation, at any age, exists when the passion to influence
others seems to overbalance the established
character and give it an obvious twist or pose. It
is instructive to find that even Darwin was, in his
childhood, capable of departing from truth for the
sake of making an impression. “For instance,” he
says in his autobiography, “I once gathered much
valuable fruit from my father’s trees and hid it in
the shrubbery, and then ran in breathless haste to
spread the news that I had discovered a hoard of
stolen fruit.”<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The young performer soon learns to be different
things to different people, showing that he begins to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>apprehend personality and to foresee its operation.
If the mother or nurse is more tender than just she
will almost certainly be “worked” by systematic
weeping. It is a matter of common observation that
children often behave worse with their mother than
with other and less sympathetic people. Of the
new persons that a child sees it is evident that
some make a strong impression and awaken a desire
to interest and please them, while others are indifferent
or repugnant. Sometimes the reason can be
perceived or guessed, sometimes not; but the fact of
selective interest, admiration, prestige, is obvious before
the end of the second year. By that time a
child already cares much for the reflection of himself
upon one personality and little for that upon another.
Moreover, he soon claims intimate and tractable
persons as <em>mine</em>, classes them among his other
possessions, and maintains his ownership against all
comers. M., at three years of age, vigorously resented
R.’s claim upon their mother. The latter was “<em>my</em>
mamma,” whenever the point was raised.</p>

<p class='c012'>Strong joy and grief depend upon the treatment
this rudimentary social self receives. In the case
of M. I noticed as early as the fourth month a
“hurt” way of crying which seemed to indicate a
sense of personal slight. It was quite different from
the cry of pain or that of anger, but seemed about
the same as the cry of fright. The slightest tone of
reproof would produce it. On the other hand, if
people took notice and laughed and encouraged, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>was hilarious. At about fifteen months old she had
become “a perfect little actress,” seeming to live
largely in imaginations of her effect upon other people.
She constantly and obviously laid traps for attention,
and looked abashed or wept at any signs of
disapproval or indifference. At times it would seem
as if she could not get over these repulses, but would
cry long in a grieved way, refusing to be comforted.
If she hit upon any little trick that made people laugh
she would be sure to repeat it, laughing loudly and
affectedly in imitation. She had quite a repertory of
these small performances, which she would display to
a sympathetic audience, or even try upon strangers.
I have seen her at sixteen months, when R. refused
to give her the scissors, sit down and make believe
cry, putting up her under lip and snuffling, meanwhile
looking up now and then to see what effect she
was producing.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>In such phenomena we have plainly enough, it
seems to me, the germ of personal ambition of every
sort. Imagination co-operating with instinctive self-feeling
has already created a social “I,” and this has
become a principal object of interest and endeavor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Progress from this point is chiefly in the way of a
greater definiteness, fulness, and inwardness in the
imagination of the other’s state of mind. A little
child thinks of and tries to elicit certain visible or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>audible phenomena, and does not go back of them;
but what a grown-up person desires to produce in
others is an internal, invisible condition which his
own richer experience enables him to imagine, and
of which expression is only the sign. Even adults,
however, make no separation between what other people
think and the visible expression of that thought.
They imagine the whole thing at once, and their idea
differs from that of a child chiefly in the comparative
richness and complexity of the elements that accompany
and interpret the visible or audible sign. There
is also a progress from the naïve to the subtle in
socially self-assertive action. A child obviously and
simply, at first, does things for effect. Later there
is an endeavor to suppress the appearance of doing
so; affection, indifference, contempt, etc., are simulated
to hide the real wish to affect the self-image. It
is perceived that an obvious seeking after good opinion
is weak and disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c012'>I doubt whether there are any regular stages in the
development of social self-feeling and expression common
to the majority of children. The sentiments of
self develop by imperceptible gradations out of the
crude appropriative instinct of new-born babes, and
their manifestations vary indefinitely in different cases.
Many children show “self-consciousness” conspicuously
from the first half year; others have little appearance
of it at any age. Still others pass through
periods of affectation whose length and time of occurrence
would probably be found to be exceedingly various.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>In childhood, as at all times of life, absorption
in some idea other than that of the social self
tends to drive “self-consciousness” out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearly everyone, however, whose turn of mind is at
all imaginative goes through a season of passionate
self-feeling during adolescence, when, according to
current belief, the social impulses are stimulated in
connection with the rapid development of the functions
of sex. This is a time of hero-worship, of high
resolve, of impassioned reverie, of vague but fierce
ambition, of strenuous imitation that seems affected,
of <em>gêne</em> in the presence of the other sex or of superior
persons, and so on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many autobiographies describe the social self-feeling
of youth which, in the case of strenuous, susceptible
natures, prevented by weak health or uncongenial
surroundings from gaining the sort of success proper
to that age, often attains extreme intensity. This is
quite generally the case with the youth of men of
genius, whose exceptional endowment and tendencies
usually isolate them more or less from the ordinary
life about them. In the autobiography of John Addington
Symonds we have an account of the feelings
of an ambitious boy suffering from ill-health, plainness
of feature—peculiarly mortifying to his strong
æsthetic instincts—and mental backwardness. “I
almost resented the attentions paid me as my father’s
son,&#160;... I regarded them as acts of charitable
condescension. Thus I passed into an attitude of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>haughty shyness which had nothing respectable in it
except a sort of self-reliant, world-defiant pride, a
resolution to effectuate myself, and to win what I
wanted by my exertions.... I vowed to raise
myself somehow or other to eminence of some sort....
I felt no desire for wealth, no mere wish to
cut a figure in society. But I thirsted with intolerable
thirst for eminence, for recognition as a personality.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a>...
The main thing which sustained me
was a sense of self—imperious, antagonistic, unmalleable.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a>...
My external self in these many ways
was being perpetually snubbed, and crushed, and
mortified. Yet the inner self hardened after a dumb,
blind fashion. I kept repeating, ‘Wait, wait. I will,
I shall, I must.’”<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> At Oxford he overhears a conversation
in which his abilities are depreciated and it is
predicted that he will not get his “first.” “The
sting of it remained in me; and though I cared little
enough for first classes, I then and there resolved
that I would win the best first of my year. This kind
of grit in me has to be notified. Nothing aroused
it so much as a seeming slight, exciting my rebellious
manhood.”<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Again he exclaims, “I look round me
and find nothing in which I excel.”<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a>... “I
fret because I do not realize ambition, because I
have no active work, and cannot win a position of
importance like other men.”<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>This sort of thing is familiar in literature, and very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>likely in our own experience. It seems worth while
to recall it and to point out that this primal need of
self-effectuation, to adopt Mr. Symonds’s phrase, is
the essence of ambition, and always has for its object
the production of some effect upon the minds of
other people. We feel in the quotations above the
indomitable surging up of the individualizing, militant
force of which self-feeling seems to be the organ.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sex-difference in the development of the social self
is apparent from the first. Girls have, as a rule, a
more impressible social sensibility; they care more
obviously for the social image, study it, reflect upon
it more, and so have even during the first year an
appearance of subtlety, <em>finesse</em>, often of affectation, in
which boys are comparatively lacking. Boys are
more taken up with muscular activity for its own sake
and with construction, their imaginations are occupied
somewhat less with persons and more with things.
In a girl <em>das ewig Weibliche</em>, not easy to describe
but quite unmistakable, appears as soon as she begins
to take notice of people, and one phase of it is
certainly an ego less simple and stable, a stronger
impulse to go over to the other person’s point of
view and to stake joy and grief on the image in his
mind. There can be no doubt that women are as a
rule more dependent upon immediate personal support
and corroboration than are men. The thought
of the woman needs to fix itself upon some person
in whose mind she can find a stable and compelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>image of herself by which to live. If such an image
is found, either in a visible or an ideal person, the
power of devotion to it becomes a source of strength.
But it is a sort of strength dependent upon this personal
complement, without which the womanly character
is somewhat apt to become a derelict and drifting
vessel. Men being built more for aggression,
have, relatively, a greater power of standing alone.
But no one can really stand alone, and the appearance
of it is due simply to a greater momentum and
continuity of character which stores up the past and
resists immediate influences. Directly or indirectly
the imagination of how we appear to others is a controlling
force in all normal minds.</p>

<p class='c012'>The vague but potent phases of the self associated
with the instinct of sex may be regarded, like other
phases, as expressive of a need to exert power and as
having reference to personal function. The youth, I
take it, is bashful precisely because he is conscious of
the vague stirring of an aggressive instinct which he
does not know how either to effectuate or to ignore.
And it is perhaps much the same with the other sex:
the bashful are always aggressive at heart; they are
conscious of an interest in the other person, of a need
to be something to him. And the more developed
sexual passion, in both sexes, is very largely an emotion
of power, domination, or appropriation. There
is no state of feeling that says “mine, mine,” more
fiercely. The need to be appropriated or dominated
which, in women at least, is equally powerful, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>of the same nature at bottom, having for its object
the attracting to itself of a masterful passion. “The
desire of the man is for the woman, but the desire of
the woman is for the desire of the man.”<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Although boys have generally a less impressionable
social self than girls, there is great difference among
them in this regard. Some of them have a marked
tendency to <em>finesse</em> and posing, while others have
almost none. The latter have a less vivid personal
imagination; they are unaffected chiefly, perhaps, because
they have no vivid idea of how they seem to
others, and so are not moved to seem rather than to
be; they are unresentful of slights because they do
not feel them, not ashamed or jealous or vain or
proud or remorseful, because all these imply imagination
of another’s mind. I have known children who
showed no tendency whatever to lie; in fact, could
not understand the nature or object of lying or of any
sort of concealment, as in such games as hide-and-coop.
This excessively simple way of looking at
things may come from unusual absorption in the observation
and analysis of the impersonal, as appeared
to be the case with R., whose interest in other facts and
their relations so much preponderated over his interest
in personal attitudes that there was no temptation
to sacrifice the former to the latter. A child of this
sort gives the impression of being non-moral; he
neither sins nor repents, and has not the knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>of good and evil. We eat of the tree of this knowledge
when we begin to imagine the minds of others,
and so become aware of that conflict of personal impulses
which conscience aims to allay.</p>

<p class='c012'>Simplicity is a pleasant thing in children, or at any
age, but it is not necessarily admirable, nor is affectation
altogether a thing of evil. To be normal, to be
at home in the world, with a prospect of power, usefulness,
or success, the person must have that imaginative
insight into other minds that underlies tact and
<em>savoir faire</em>, morality, and beneficence. This insight
involves sophistication, some understanding and sharing
of the clandestine impulses of human nature. A
simplicity that is merely the lack of this insight
indicates a sort of defect. There is, however, another
kind of simplicity, belonging to a character that
is subtle and sensitive, but has sufficient force and
mental clearness to keep in strict order the many
impulses to which it is open, and so preserve its
directness and unity. One may be simple like
Simple Simon, or in the sense that Emerson meant
when he said, “To be simple is to be great.” Affectation,
vanity and the like, indicate the lack of
proper assimilation of the influences arising from
our sense of what others think of us. Instead of
these influences working upon the individual gradually
and without disturbing his equilibrium, they
overbear him so that he appears to be not himself,
posing, out of function, and hence silly, weak,
contemptible. The affected smile, the “foolish face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of praise” is a type of all affectation, an external,
put-on thing, a weak and fatuous petition for approval.
Whenever one is growing rapidly, learning
eagerly, preoccupied with strange ideals, he is in
danger of this loss of equilibrium; and so we notice
it in sensitive children, especially girls, in young
people between fourteen and twenty, and at all ages
in persons of unstable individuality.</p>

<p class='c012'>This disturbance of our equilibrium by the outgoing
of the imagination toward another person’s
point of view means that we are undergoing his influence.
In the presence of one whom we feel to be
of importance there is a tendency to enter into and
adopt, by sympathy, his judgment of ourself, to put
a new value on ideas and purposes, to recast life in
his image. With a very sensitive person this tendency
is often evident to others in ordinary conversation
and in trivial matters. By force of an impulse springing
directly from the delicacy of his perceptions
he is continually imagining how he appears to his interlocutor,
and accepting the image, for the moment,
as himself. If the other appears to think him well-informed
on some recondite matter, he is likely to
assume a learned expression; if thought judicious he
looks as if he were, if accused of dishonesty he appears
guilty, and so on. In short, a sensitive man,
in the presence of an impressive personality, tends to
become, for the time, his interpretation of what the
other thinks he is. It is only the heavy-minded who
will not feel this to be true, in some degree, of themselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Of course it is usually a temporary and
somewhat superficial phenomenon; but it is typical
of all ascendency, and helps us to understand how
persons have power over us through some hold upon
our imaginations, and how our personality grows and
takes form by divining the appearance of our present
self to other minds.</p>

<p class='c012'>So long as a character is open and capable of
growth it retains a corresponding impressibility,
which is not weakness unless it swamps the assimilating
and organizing faculty. I know men whose
careers are a proof of stable and aggressive character
who have an almost feminine sensitiveness regarding
their seeming to others. Indeed, if one sees a man
whose attitude toward others is always assertive, never
receptive, he may be confident that man will never
go far, because he will never learn much. In character,
as in every phase of life, health requires a just
union of stability with plasticity.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a vague excitement of the social self more
general than any particular emotion or sentiment.
Thus the mere presence of people, a “sense of other
persons,” as Professor Baldwin says, and an awareness
of their observation, often causes a vague discomfort,
doubt, and tension. One feels that there is
a social image of himself lurking about, and not
knowing what it is he is obscurely alarmed. Many
people, perhaps most, feel more or less agitation and
embarrassment under the observation of strangers,
and for some even sitting in the same room with unfamiliar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>or uncongenial people is harassing and exhausting.
It is well known, for instance, that a visit
from a stranger would often cost Darwin his night’s
sleep, and many similar examples could be collected
from the records of men of letters. At this point,
however, it is evident that we approach the borders
of mental pathology.</p>

<p class='c011'>Possibly some will think that I exaggerate the
importance of social self-feeling by taking persons
and periods of life that are abnormally sensitive.
But I believe that with all normal and human people
it remains, in one form or another, the mainspring
of endeavor and a chief interest of the imagination
throughout life. As is the case with other feelings,
we do not think much of it so long as it is moderately
and regularly gratified. Many people of balanced
mind and congenial activity scarcely know
that they care what others think of them, and will
deny, perhaps with indignation, that such care is an
important factor in what they are and do. But this
is illusion. If failure or disgrace arrives, if one suddenly
finds that the faces of men show coldness or
contempt instead of the kindliness and deference
that he is used to, he will perceive from the shock,
the fear, the sense of being outcast and helpless,
that he was living in the minds of others without
knowing it, just as we daily walk the solid ground
without thinking how it bears us up. This fact is
so familiar in literature, especially in modern novels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>that it ought to be obvious enough. The works
of George Eliot are particularly strong in the exposition
of it. In most of her novels there is some
character like Mr. Bulstrode in “Middlemarch” or
Mr. Jermyn in “Felix Holt,” whose respectable and
long-established social image of himself is shattered
by the coming to light of hidden truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is true, however, that the attempt to describe the
social self and to analyze the mental processes that
enter into it almost unavoidably makes it appear
more reflective and “self-conscious” than it usually
is. Thus while some readers will be able to discover
in themselves a quite definite and deliberate contemplation
of the reflected self, others will perhaps
find nothing but a sympathetic impulse, so simple
that it can hardly be made the object of distinct
thought. Many people whose behavior shows that
their idea of themselves is largely caught from the
persons they are with, are yet quite innocent of any
intentional posing; it is a matter of subconscious
impulse or mere suggestion. The self of very sensitive
but non-reflective minds is of this character.</p>

<p class='c011'>If self and the self-seeking that springs from it are
healthy and respectable traits of human nature, then
what are those things which we call egotism and selfishness,<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
and which are so commonly regarded as
objectionable? The answer to this appears to be
that it is not self-assertion as such that we stigmatize
by these names, but the assertion of a kind or phase
of self that is obnoxious to us. So long as we agree
with a man’s thoughts and aims we do not think of
him as selfish or egotistical, however urgently he may
assert them; but so soon as we cease to agree, while
he continues persistent and perhaps intrusive, we are
likely to say hard things about him. It is at bottom
a matter of moral judgment, not to be comprised in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>any simple definition, but to be determined by conscience
after the whole situation is taken into account.
In this regard it is essentially one with the more general
question of misconduct or personal badness.
There is no distinct line between the behavior which
we mildly censure as selfish and that which we call
wicked or criminal; it is only a matter of degree.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is quite apparent that mere self-assertion is not
looked upon as selfishness. There is nothing more
respected—and even liked—than a persistent and successful
pursuit of one’s peculiar aims, so long as this
is done within the accepted limits of fairness and
consideration for others. Thus one who has acquired
ten millions must have expressed his appropriative
instinct with much energy and constancy, but reasonable
people do not conclude that he is selfish unless
it appears that he has ignored social sentiments by
which he should have been guided. If he has been
dishonest, mean, hard, or the like, they will condemn
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The men we admire most, including those we look
upon as peculiarly good, are invariably men of notable
self-assertion. Thus Martin Luther, to take a
conspicuous instance, was a man of the most intense
self-feeling, resentful of opposition, dogmatic, with
“an absolute confidence in the infallibility, practically
speaking, of his own judgment.” This is a trait belonging
to nearly all great leaders, and a main cause
of their success. That which distinguishes Luther
from the vulgarly ambitious and aggressive people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>we know is not the quality of his self-feeling, but
the fact that it was identified in his imagination
and endeavors with sentiments and purposes that
we look upon as noble, progressive, or right. No
one could be more ambitious than he was, or more
determined to secure the social aggrandizement of
his self; but in his case the self for which he
was ambitious and resentful consisted largely of
certain convictions regarding justification by faith,
the sacrilege of the sale of indulgences, and, more
generally, of an enfranchising spirit and mode of
thought fit to awaken and lead the aspiration of the
time.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is evident enough that in this respect Luther is
typical of aggressive reformers in our own and every
other time. Does not every efficient clergyman, philanthropist,
or teacher become such by identifying
some worthy object with a vigorous self-feeling? Is
it ever really possible to separate the feeling for the
cause from the feeling that it is <em>my</em> cause? I doubt
whether it is. Some of the greatest and purest founders
and propagators of religion have been among the
greatest egotists in the sense that they openly identified
the idea of good with the idea of self, and spoke
of the two interchangeably. And I cannot think of
any strong man I have known, however good, who
does not seem to me to have had intense self-feeling
about his cherished affair; though if his affair was a
large and helpful one no one would call him selfish.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since the judgment that a man is or is not selfish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>is a question of sympathies, it naturally follows that
people easily disagree regarding it, their views depending
much upon their temperaments and habits of
thought. There are probably few energetic persons
who do not make an impression of egotism upon some
of their acquaintances; and, on the other hand, how
many there are whose selfishness seems obvious to
most people, but is not apparent to their wives,
sisters and mothers. In so far as our self is identified
with that of another it is, of course, unlikely that the
aims of the latter should be obnoxious to us.</p>

<p class='c012'>If we should question many persons as to why
they thought this or that man selfish, a common
answer would probably be, “He does not consider
other people.” What this means is that he is inappreciative
of the social situation as we see it; that
the situation does not awaken in him the same personal
sentiments that it does in us, and so his action
wounds those sentiments. Thus the commonest and
most obvious form of selfishness is perhaps the failure
to subordinate sensual impulses to social feeling,
and this, of course, results from the apathy of
the imaginative impulses that ought to effect this
subordination. It would usually be impossible for a
man to help himself to the best pieces on the platter
if he conceived the disgust and resentment which he
excites. And though this is a very gross and palpable
sort of selfishness, it is analogous in nature to the
finer kinds. A fine-grained, subtle Egoist, such as is
portrayed in George Meredith’s novel of that name,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>or such as Isabel’s husband in Henry James’s “Portrait
of a Lady,” has delicate perceptions in certain
directions, but along with these there is some essential
narrowness or vulgarity of imagination which
prevents him from grasping what we feel to be the
true social situation, and having the sentiments that
should respond to it. The æsthetic refinement of
Osmond which so impresses Isabel before her marriage
turns out to be compatible with a general smallness
of mind. He is “not a good fellow,” as Ralph
remarks, and incapable of comprehending her or her
friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>A lack of tact in face-to-face intercourse very commonly
gives an impression of egotism, even when it
is a superficial trait not really expressive of an unsympathetic
character. Thus there are persons who
in the simplest conversation do not seem to forget
themselves, and enter frankly and disinterestedly into
the subject, but are felt to be always preoccupied
with the thought of the impression they are making,
imagining praise or depreciation, and usually posing
a little to avoid the one or gain the other. Such
people are uneasy, and make others so; no relaxation
is possible in their company, because they never
come altogether out into open and common ground,
but are always keeping back something. It is not so
much that they have self-feeling as that it is clandestine
and furtive, giving one a sense of insecurity.
Sometimes they are aware of this lack of frankness,
and try to offset it by reckless confessions, but this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>only shows their self-consciousness in another and
hardly more agreeable aspect. Perhaps the only
cure for this sort of egotism is to cherish very high
and difficult ambitions, and so drain off the superabundance
of self-feeling from these petty channels.
People who are doing really important things usually
appear simple and unaffected in conversation, largely
because their selves are healthfully employed elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c012'>One who has tact always sees far enough into the
state of mind of the person with whom he is conversing
to adapt himself to it and to seem, at least,
sympathetic; he is sure to feel the situation. But if
you tread upon the other person’s toes, talk about
yourself when he is not interested in that subject,
and, in general, show yourself out of touch with his
mind, he very naturally finds you disagreeable. And
behavior analogous to this in the more enduring
relations of life gives rise to a similar judgment.</p>

<p class='c012'>So far as there is any agreement in judgments regarding
selfishness it arises from common standards
of right, fairness, and courtesy which all thoughtful
minds work out from their experience, and which
represent what the general good requires. The selfish
man is one in whose self, or in whose style of
asserting it, is something that falls below these
standards. He is a transgressor of fair play and the
rules of the game, an outlaw with whom no one ought
to sympathize, but against whom all should unite for
the general good.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>It is the unhealthy or egotistical self that is usually
meant by the word self when used in moral discussions;
it is this that people need to get away
from, both for their own good and that of the community.
When we speak of getting out of one’s
“self” we commonly mean <em>any line of thought with
which one tends to be unduly preoccupied</em>; so that to
escape from it is indeed a kind of salvation.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is perhaps no sort of self more subject to
dangerous egotism than that which deludes itself
with the notion that it is not a self at all, but something
else. It is well to beware of persons who believe
that the cause, the mission, the philanthropy,
the hero, or whatever it may be that they strive for,
is outside of themselves, so that they feel a certain
irresponsibility, and are likely to do things which
they would recognize as wrong if done in behalf of
an acknowledged self. Just as the Spanish armies
in the Netherlands held that their indulgence in
murder, torture, and brutal lust was sanctified by the
supposed holy character of their mission, so in our
own time the name of religion, science, patriotism, or
charity sometimes enables people to indulge comfortably
in browbeating, intrusion, slander, dishonesty,
and the like. <em>Every cherished idea is a self</em>:
and though it appear to the individual, or to a
class, or to a whole nation, worthy to swallow up
all other selves, it is subject to the same need of
discipline under rules of justice and decency as any
other. It is healthy for everyone to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>that he is, and will remain, a self-seeker, and that if
he gets out of one self he is sure to form another
which may stand in equal need of control.</p>

<p class='c012'>Selfishness as a mental trait is always some sort
of narrowness, littleness or defect; an inadequacy of
imagination. The perfectly balanced and vigorous
mind can hardly be selfish, because it cannot be oblivious
to any important social situation, either in
immediate intercourse or in more permanent relations;
it must always tend to be sympathetic, fair,
and just, because it possesses that breadth and unity
of view of which these qualities are the natural expression.
To lack them is to be not altogether social
and human, and may be regarded as the beginning
of degeneracy. Egotism is then not something
additional to ordinary human nature, as the common
way of speaking suggests, but rather a lack. The
egotist is not more than a man, but less than a man;
and as regards personal power he is as a rule the
weaker for his egotism. The very fact that he has a
bad name shows that the world is against him, and
that he is contending against odds. The success of
selfishness attracts attention and exaggeration because
it is hateful to us; but the really strong generally
work within the prevalent standards of justice
and courtesy, and so escape condemnation.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is infinite variety in egotism; but an important
division may be based on the greater or less
stability of the egotists’ characters. According to
this we may divide them into those of the unstable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>type and those of the rigid type. Extreme instability
is always selfish; the very weak cannot be otherwise,
because they lack both the deep sympathy that
enables people to penetrate the lives of others, and
the consistency and self-control necessary to make
sympathy effective if they had it. Their superficial
and fleeting impulses are as likely to work harm as
good and cannot be trusted to bring forth any sound
fruit. If they are amiable at times they are sure to
be harsh, cold, or violent at other times; there is no
justice, no solid good or worth in them. The sort of
people I have in mind are, for instance, such as in
times of affliction go about weeping and wringing
their hands to the neglect of their duty to aid and
comfort the survivors, possibly taking credit for the
tenderness of their hearts.</p>

<p class='c012'>The other sort of egotism, not sharply distinguished
from this in all cases, belongs to people who
have stability of mind and conduct, but still without
breadth and richness of sympathy, so that their aims
and sentiments are inadequate to the life around
them—narrow, hard, mean, self-satisfied, or sensual.
This I would call the rigid type of egotism because
the essence of it is an arrest of sympathetic development
and an ossification as it were of what should
be a plastic and growing part of thought. Something
of this sort is perhaps what is most commonly
meant by the word, and everyone can think of harsh,
gross, grasping, cunning, or self-complacent traits to
which he would apply it. The self, to be healthy or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>to be tolerable to other selves, must be ever moving
on, breaking loose from lower habits, walking hand-in-hand
with sympathy and aspiration. If it stops
too long anywhere it becomes stagnant and diseased,
odious to other minds and harmful to the mind it inhabits.
The men that satisfy the imagination are
chastened men; large, human, inclusive, feeling the
breadth of the world. It is impossible to think of
Shakespeare as arrogant, vain, or sensual; and if
some, like Dante, had an exigent ego, they succeeded
in transforming it into higher and higher forms.</p>

<p class='c012'>Selfishness of the stable or rigid sort is as a rule
more bitterly resented than the more fickle variety,
chiefly, no doubt, because, having more continuity
and purpose, it is more formidable.</p>

<p class='c012'>One who accepts the idea of self, and of personality
in general, already set forth, will agree that what is
ordinarily called egotism cannot properly be regarded
as the opposite of “altruism,” or of any word implying
the self-and-other classification of impulses. No
clear or useful idea of selfishness can be reached on
the basis of this classification, which, as previously
stated, seems to me fictitious. It misrepresents the
mental situation, and so tends to confuse thought.
The mind has not, in fact, two sets of motives to
choose from, the self-motives and the other-motives,
the latter of which stand for the higher course, but
has the far more difficult task of achieving a higher
life by gradually discriminating and organizing a
great variety of motives not easily divisible into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>moral groups. The proper antithesis of selfishness is
right, justice, breadth, magnanimity, or something of
that sort; something opposite to the narrowness of
feeling and action in which selfishness essentially
consists. It is a matter of more or less symmetry
and stature, like the contrast between a gnarled and
stunted tree and one of ample growth.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ideas denoted by such phrases as <em>my</em> friend,
<em>my</em> country, <em>my</em> duty, and so on, are just the ones
that stand for broad or “unselfish” impulses, and
yet they are self-ideas as shown by the first-personal
pronoun. In the expression “<em>my duty</em>” we have
in six letters a refutation of that way of thinking
which makes right the opposite of self. That it
stands for the right all will admit; and yet no one
can pronounce it meaningly without perceiving that
it is charged with intense self-feeling.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is always vain to try to separate the outer aspect
of a motive, the other people, the cause or the
like, which we think of as external, from the private
or self aspect, which we think of as internal. The
apparent separation is purely illusive. It is surely
a very simple truth that what makes us act in an
unselfish or devoted manner is always some sort of
sentiment in our own minds, and if we cherish this
sentiment intimately it is a part of ourselves. We develop
the inner life by outwardly directed thought
and action, relating mostly to other persons, to
causes, and the like. Is there no difference, then,
it may be asked, between doing a kind act to please
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>someone else and doing it to please one’s self? I
should say regarding this that while it is obvious, if
one thinks of it, that pleasing another can exist for
me only as a pleasant feeling in my own mind, which
is the motive of my action, there is a difference in
the meaning of these expressions as commonly used.
Pleasing one’s self ordinarily means that we act from
some comparatively narrow sentiment not involving
penetrating sympathy. Thus, if one gives Christmas
presents to make a good impression or from a sense of
propriety, he might be said to do it to please himself,
while if he really imagined the pleasure the gift would
bring to the recipient he would do it to please the
latter. But it is clear enough that his own pleasure
might be quite as great in the second case. Again,
sometimes we do things “to please others” which
we declare are painful to ourselves. But this, of
course, means merely that there are conflicting impulses
in our own minds, some of which are sacrificed
to others. The satisfaction, or whatever you
choose to call it, that one gets when he prefers his
duty to some other course is just as much his own as
any pleasure he renounces. No self-sacrifice is admirable
that is not the choice of a higher or larger
aspect of the self over a lower or partial aspect. If
a man’s act is really self-sacrifice, that is, not properly
<em>his own</em>, he would better not do it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some opponent of Darwin attempted to convict him
of egotism by counting the number of times that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>pronoun “I” appears upon the first few pages of the
“Origin of Species.” He was able to find a great
many, and to cause Darwin, who was as modest a man
as ever lived, to feel abashed at the showing; but it
is doubtful if he convinced any reader of the book of
the truth of the assertion. In fact, although the dictionary
defines egotism as “the habit or practice of
thinking and talking much of one’s self,” the use of
the first-personal pronoun is hardly the essence of
the matter. This use is always in some degree a self-assertion,
but it has a disagreeable or egotistical effect
only in so far as the self asserted is repellent to us.
Even Montaigne, who says “I” on every other line,
and whose avowed purpose is to display himself at
large and in all possible detail, does not, it seems to
me, really make an impression of egotism upon the
congenial reader, because he contrives to make his
self so interesting in every aspect that the more we
are reminded of it the better we are pleased; and there
is good sense in his doctrine that “not to speak
roundly of a man’s self implies some lack of courage;
a firm and lofty judgment, and that judges soundly
and surely, makes use of his own example upon all
occasions, as well as those of others.” A person will
not displease sensible people by saying “I” so long
as the self thus asserted stands for something, is
a pertinent, significant “I,” and not merely a random
self-intrusion. We are not displeased to see an athlete
roll up his sleeves and show his muscles, although
if a man of only ordinary development did so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>it would seem an impertinence; nor do we think less
of Rembrandt for painting his own portrait every
few months. The “I” should be functional, and so
long as a man is functioning acceptably there can be
no objection to his using it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed, it is a common remark that the most delightful
companions, or authors of books, are often
the most egotistical in the sense that they are always
talking about themselves. The reason for this is that
if the “I” is interesting and agreeable we adopt it
for the time being and make it our own. Then,
being on the inside as it were, it is our own self that
is so expansive and happy. We adopt Montaigne, or
Lamb, or Thackeray, or Stevenson, or Whitman, or
Thoreau, and think of their words as our words.
Thus even extravagant self-assertion, if the reader
can only be led to enter into it, may be congenial.
There may be quite as much egotism in the suppression
of “I” as in the use of it, and a forced and
obvious avoidance of this pronoun often gives a disagreeable
feeling of the writer’s self-consciousness.
In short, egotism is a matter of character, not of
forms of language, and if we are egotists the fact
will out in spite of any conventional rules of decorum
that we may follow.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is possible to maintain that “I” is a more modest
pronoun than “one,” by which some writers seem
to wish to displace it. If a man says “I think,”
he speaks only for himself, while if he says “one
thinks,” he insinuates that the opinion advanced is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>general or normal view. To say “one does not like
this picture,” is a more deadly attack upon it than to
say “I do not like it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It would seem also that more freedom of self-expression
is appropriate to a book than to ordinary
intercourse, because people are not obliged to read
books, and the author has a right to assume that his
readers are, in a general way, sympathetic with that
phase of his personality that he is trying to express.
If we do not sympathize why do we continue to read?
We may, however, find fault with him if he departs
from that which it is the proper function of the book
to assert, and intrudes a weak and irrelevant “I” in
which he has no reason to suppose us interested. I
presume we can all think of books that might apparently
be improved by going through them and
striking out passages in which the author has incontinently
expressed an aspect of himself that has no
proper place in the work.</p>

<p class='c011'>In every higher kind of production a person needs
to understand and believe in himself—the more
thoroughly the better. It is precisely that in him
which he feels to be worthy and at the same time
peculiar—the characteristic—that it is his duty to
produce, communicate, and realize; and he cannot
possess this, cannot differentiate it, cleanse it from
impurities, consolidate and organize it, except through
prolonged and interested self-contemplation. Only
this can enable him to free himself from the imitative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>on the one hand and the whimsical on the other, and
to stand forth without shame or arrogance for what
he truly is. Consequently every productive mind
must have intense self-feeling; it must delight to
contemplate the characteristic, to gloat over it if
you please, and in this way learn to define, arrange,
and express it. If one will take up a work
of literary art like, say, the “Sentimental Journey,”
he will see that a main source of the charm of it
is in the writer’s assured and contented familiarity
with himself. A man who writes like that has delighted
to brood over his thoughts, jealously excluding
everything not wholly congenial to him, and
gradually working out an adequate expression. And
the superiority, or at least the difference, in tone and
manner of the earlier English literature as compared
with that of the nineteenth century is apparently
connected with a more assured and reposeful self-possession
on the part of the older writers, made
possible, no doubt, by a less urgent general life.
The same fact of self-intensity goes with notable
production in all sorts of literature, in every art, in
statesmanship, philanthropy, religion; in all kinds of
career.</p>

<p class='c012'>Who does not feel at times what Goethe calls the
joy of dwelling in one’s self, of surrounding himself
with the fruits of his own mind, with things he has
made, perhaps, books he has chosen, his familiar
clothes and possessions of all sorts, with his wife,
children, and old friends, and with his own thoughts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>which some, like Robert Louis Stevenson, confess to
a love of re-reading in books, letters, or diaries? At
times even conscientious people, perhaps, look kindly
at their own faults, deficiencies, and mannerisms,
precisely as they would on those of a familiar friend.
Without self-love in some such sense as this any
solid and genial growth of character and accomplishment
is hardly possible. “Whatever any man has
to effect must emanate from him like a second self;
and how could this be possible were not his first self
entirely pervaded by it?” Nor is it opposed to the
love of others. “Indeed,” says Mr. Stevenson, “he
who loves himself, not in idle vanity, but with a
plenitude of knowledge, is the best equipped of all
to love his neighbors.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Self-love, Shakespeare says, is not so vile a sin as
self-neglecting; and many serious varieties of the
latter might be specified. There is, for instance, a
culpable sort of self-dreading cowardice, not at all
uncommon with sensitive people, which shrinks from
developing and asserting a just “I” because of the
stress of self-feeling—of vanity, uncertainty, and mortification—which
is foreseen and shunned. If one is
liable to these sentiments the proper course is to bear
with them as with other disturbing conditions, rather
than to allow them to stand in the way of what, after
all, one is born to do. “Know your own bone,” says
Thoreau, “gnaw at it, bury it, unearth it, and gnaw
it still.”<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a> “If I am not I, who will be?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>A tendency to secretiveness very often goes with
this self-cherishing. Goethe was as amorous and
jealous about his unpublished works, in some cases,
as the master of a seraglio; fostering them for years,
and sometimes not telling his closest friends of their
existence. His Eugenie, “meine Liebling Eugenie,”
as he calls it, was vulgarized and ruined for him by
his fatal mistake in publishing the first part before
the whole was complete. It would not be difficult
to show that the same cherishing of favorite and peculiar
ideas is found also in painters, sculptors, and
effective persons of every sort. As was suggested
in an earlier chapter, this secretiveness has a social
reference, and few works of art could be carried
through if the artist was convinced they would have
no value in the eyes of anyone else. He hides his
work that he may purify and perfect it, thus making
it at once more wholly and delightfully his own and
also more valuable to the world in the end. As soon
as the painter exhibits his picture he loses it, in a
sense; his system of ideas about it becomes more or
less confused and disorganized by the inrush of impressions
arising from a sense of what other people
think of it; it is no longer the perfect and intimate
thing which his thought cherished, but has become
somewhat crude, vulgar, and disgusting, so that if
he is sensitive he may wish never to look upon it
again. This, I take it, is why Goethe could not finish
Eugenie, and why Guignet, a French painter, of
whom Hamerton speaks, used to alter or throw away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>a painting that anyone by chance saw upon the easel.
Likewise it was in order more perfectly to know
and express himself—in his book called “A Week on
the Concord and Merrimack Rivers”—that Thoreau
retired to Walden Pond, and it was doubtless with
the same view that Descartes quitted Paris and dwelt
for eight years in Holland, concealing even his place
of residence. The Self, like a child, is not likely to
hold its own in the world unless it has had a mature
prenatal development.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be said, perhaps, that these views contradict
a well-known fact, namely, that we do our best
work when we are not self-conscious, not thinking
about effect, but filled with disinterested and impersonal
passion. Such truth as there is in this idea is,
however, in no way inconsistent with what has just
been said. It is true that a certain abandonment
and self-forgetting is often characteristic of high
thought and noble action. But there would be no
production, no high thought or noble action, if we
relied entirely upon these impassioned moments
without preparing ourselves to have them. It is
only as we have self-consciousness that we can be
aware of those special tendencies which we assert
in production, or can learn how to express them,
or even have the desire to do so. The moment of
insight would be impossible without the persistent
self-conscious endeavor that preceded it, nor has enthusiastic
action any value without a similar discipline.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>It is true, also, that in sensitive persons self-feeling
often reaches a pitch of irritability that impedes production,
or vulgarizes it through too great deference
to opinion. But this is a matter of the control and
discipline of particular aspects of the self rather than
of its general tendency. When undisciplined this
sort of feeling may be futile or harmful, just as fear,
whose function is to cause us to avoid danger, may
defeat its own aim through excessive and untimely
operation, and anger may so excite us that we lose
the power of inflicting injury.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the people of our time and country are peculiarly
selfish, as is sometimes alleged, it is certainly
not because a too rigid or clearly differentiated type
of self-consciousness is general among us. On the
contrary, our most characteristic fault is perhaps a
certain superficiality and vagueness of character and
aims; and this seems to spring from a lack of collectedness
and self-definition, which in turn is connected
with the too eager mode of life common among us.
I doubt, however, whether egotism, which is essentially
a falling short of moral standards, can be said
to be more prevalent in one age than another.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Mr. Roget’s “Thesaurus” may be found about
six pages devoted to words denoting “Extrinsic personal
affections, or personal affections derived from
the opinions or feelings of others,” an expression
which seems to mean nearly the same as is here meant
by social self-feeling of the reflected or looking-glass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>sort. Although the compiler fishes with a wide net
and brings in much that seems hardly to belong here,
the number of words in common use indicating different
varieties of this sort of feeling is surprising and
suggestive. One cannot but think, What insight and
what happy boldness of invention went to the devising
of all these terms! What a psychologist is language,
that thus labels and treasures up so many
subtle aspects of the human mind!</p>

<p class='c012'>We may profitably distinguish, as others have done,
two general attitudes—the aggressive or self-assertive
and the shrinking or humble. The first indicates that
one thinks favorably of himself and tries to impose
that favorable thought on others; the second, that
he accepts and yields to a depreciating reflection of
himself, and feels accordingly diminished and abased.
Pride would, of course, be an example of the first way
of feeling and acting, humility of the second.</p>

<p class='c012'>But there are many phases of the aggressive self, and
these, again, might be classified something as follows:
first, in response to imagined approval we have pride,
vanity, or self-respect; second, in response to imagined
censure we have various sorts of resentment;
and the humble self might be treated in a similar
manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pride and vanity are names which are commonly
applied only to forms of self-approval that strike us
as disagreeable or egotistical; but they may be used
in a somewhat larger sense to indicate simply a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>or less stable attitude of the social self toward the
world in which it is reflected; the distinction being
of the same sort as that between unstable and rigid
egotism already suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>These differences in stability, which are of great
importance in the study of social personality, are perhaps
connected with the contrast between the more
receptive and the more constructive types of mind.
Although in the best minds reception and construction
are harmoniously united, and although it may
be shown that they are in a measure mutually dependent,
so that neither can be perfect without the
other, yet as a rule they are not symmetrically developed,
and this lack of symmetry corresponds to
divergences of personal character. Minds of one sort
are, so to speak, endogenous or ingrowing in their natural
bent, while those of another are exogenous or
outgrowing; that is to say, those of the former kind
have a relatively strong turn for working up old material,
as compared with that for taking in new; cogitation
is more pleasant to them than observation; they
prefer the sweeping and garnishing of their house to
the confusion of entertaining visitors; while of the
other sort the opposite of this may be said. Now, the
tendency of the endogenous or inward activities is to
secure unity and stability of thought and character at
the possible expense of openness and adaptability;
because the energy goes chiefly into systematization,
and in attaining this the mind is pretty sure to limit
its new impressions to those that do not disturb too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>much that unity and system it loves so well. These
traits are, of course, manifested in the person’s relation
to others. The friends he has “and their acceptance
tried” he grapples to his soul with hooks of steel, but
is likely to be unsympathetic and hard toward influences
of a novel character. On the other hand, the
exogenous or outgrowing mind, more active near the
periphery than toward the centre, is open to all
sorts of impressions, eagerly taking in new material,
which is likely never to get much arrangement; caring
less for the order of the house than that it should be
full of guests, quickly responsive to personal influences,
but lacking that depth and tenacity of sympathy
that the other sort of mind shows with people
congenial with itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pride,<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> then, is the form social self-approval takes
in the more rigid or self-sufficient sort of minds; the
person who feels it is assured that he stands well with
others whose opinion he cares for, and does not imagine
any humiliating image of himself, but carries
his mental and social stability to such a degree that
it is likely to narrow his soul by warding off the enlivening
pricks of doubt and shame. By no means
independent of the world, it is, after all, distinctly a
social sentiment, and gets its standards ultimately
from social custom and opinion. But the proud man
is not <em>immediately</em> dependent upon what others think;
he has worked over his reflected self in his mind until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>it is a steadfast portion of his thought, an idea and
conviction apart, in some measure, from its external
origin. Hence this sentiment requires time for its
development and flourishes in mature age rather than
in the open and growing period of youth. A man
who is proud of his rank, his social position, his professional
eminence, his benevolence, or his integrity,
is in the habit of contemplating daily an agreeable
and little changing image of himself as he believes he
appears in the eyes of the world. This image is probably
distorted, since pride deceives by a narrowing of
the imagination, but it is stable, and because it is so,
because he feels sure of it, he is not disturbed by any
passing breath of blame. If he is aware of such a
thing at all he dismisses it as a vagary of no importance,
feeling the best judgment of the world to be
securely in his favor. If he should ever lose this conviction,
if some catastrophe should shatter the image,
he would be a broken man, and, if far gone in years,
would perhaps not raise his head again.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a sense pride is strength; that is, it implies a
stable and consistent character which can be counted
on; it will do its work without watching, and be honorable
in its dealings, according to its cherished
standards; it has always a vigorous, though narrow,
conscience. On the other hand, it stunts a man’s
growth by closing his mind to progressive influences,
and so in the long run may be a source of weakness.
Burke said, I believe, that no man ever had a point
of pride that was not injurious to him; and perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>this was what he meant. Pride also causes, as a rule,
a deeper animosity on the part of others than vanity;
it may be hated but hardly despised; yet many would
rather live with it than with vanity, because, after all,
one knows where to find it, and so can adapt himself
to it. The other is so whimsical that it is impossible
to foresee what turn it will take next.</p>

<p class='c012'>Language seldom distinguishes clearly between a
way of feeling and its visible expression; and so the
word vanity, which means primarily emptiness, indicates
either a weak or hollow appearance of worth
put on in the endeavor to impress others, or the state
of feeling that goes with it. It is the form social self-approval
naturally takes in a somewhat unstable mind,
not sure of its image. The vain man, in his more
confident moments, sees a delightful reflection of himself,
but knowing that it is transient, he is afraid it
will change. He has not fixed it, as the proud man
has, by incorporation with a stable habit of thought,
but, being immediately dependent for it upon others,
is at their mercy and very vulnerable, living in the
frailest of glass houses which may be shattered at any
moment; and, in fact, this catastrophe happens so
often that he gets somewhat used to it and soon recovers
from it. While the image which the proud person
contemplates is fairly consistent, and, though distorted,
has a solid basis in his character, so that he will
not accept praise for qualities he does not believe himself
to possess; vanity has no stable idea of itself and
will swallow any shining bait. The person will gloat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>now on one pleasing reflection of himself, now on another,
trying to mimic each in its turn, and becoming,
so far as he can, what any flatterer says he is, or what
any approving person seems to think he is. It is
characteristic of him to be so taken up with his own
image in the other’s mind that he is hypnotized by it,
as it were, and sees it magnified, distorted, and out of
its true relation to the other contents of that mind.
He does not see, as so often happens, that he is being
managed and made a fool of; he “gives himself
away”—fatuity being of the essence of vanity. On
the other hand, and for the same reason, a vain person
is frequently tortured by groundless imaginings
that someone has misunderstood him, slighted him,
insulted him, or otherwise mistreated his social effigy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course the immediate result of vanity is weakness,
as that of pride is strength; but on a wider view
there is something to be said for it. Goethe exclaims
in Wilhelm Meister, “Would to heaven all men were
vain! that is were vain with clear perception, with
moderation, and in a proper sense: we should then,
in the cultivated world, have happy times of it.
Women, it is told us, are vain from the very cradle;
yet does it not become them? do they not please us
the more? How can a youth form himself if he is not
vain? An empty, hollow nature will, by this means,
at least contrive to give itself an outward show, and a
proper man will soon train himself from the outside
inwards.”<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> That is to say, vanity, in moderation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>may indicate an openness, a sensibility, a teachability,
that is a good augury of growth. In youth, at least,
it is much preferable to pride.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is the obnoxious, or in some way conspicuous,
manifestations of self-feeling that are likely to receive
special names. Accordingly, there are many words
and phrases for different aspects of pride and vanity,
while a moderate and balanced self-respect does not
attract nomenclature. One who has this is more
open and flexible in feeling and behavior than one
who is proud; the image is not stereotyped, he is subject
to humility; while at the same time he does not
show the fluttering anxiety about his appearance that
goes with vanity, but has stable ways of thinking
about the image, as about other matters, and cannot
be upset by passing phases of praise or blame. In
fact, the healthy life of the self requires the same
co-operation of continuity with change that marks
normal development everywhere; there must be variability,
openness, freedom, on a basis of organization:
too rigid organization meaning fixity and death, and
the lack of it weakness or anarchy. The self-respecting
man values others’ judgments and occupies his
mind with them a great deal, but he keeps his head,
he discriminates and selects, considers all suggestions
with a view to his character, and will not submit to
influences not in the line of his development. Because
he conceives his self as a stable and continuing
whole he always feels the need to <em>be</em>, and cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>guilty of that separation between being and seeming
that constitutes affectation. For instance, a self-respecting
scholar, deferent to the standards set by the
opinions of others, might wish to have read all the
books on a certain subject, and feel somewhat
ashamed not to have done so, but he could not affect
to have read them when he had not. The pain of
breaking the unity of his thought, of disfiguring his
picture of himself as a sincere and consistent man,
would overbalance any gratification he might have in
the imagined approval of his thoroughness. If he
were vain he would possibly affect to have read the
books; while if arrogant he might feel no compunctions
for avowed ignorance of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Common-sense approves a just mingling of deference
and self-poise in the attitude of one man toward
others: while the unyielding are certainly repellent,
the too deferent are nearly as much so; they are
tiresome and even disgusting, because they seem
flimsy and unreal, and do not give that sense of contact
with something substantial and interesting that
we look for.</p>

<p class='c012'>We like the manner of a person who appears interested
in what we say and do, and not indifferent to
our opinion, but has at the same time an evident
reserve of stability and independence. It is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the same with a writer; we require of him a bold
and determined statement of his own special view—that
is what he is here for—and yet, with this, an air
of hospitality, and an appreciation that he is after all
only a small part of a large world.</p>

<p class='c012'>With some, then, the self-image is an imitative
sketch in the supposed style of the last person they
have talked to; with others, it is a rigid, traditional
thing, a lifeless repetition that has lost all relation to
the forces that originally moulded it, like the Byzantine
madonnas before the time of Cimabue; with
others again it is a true work of art in which individual
tendencies and the influence of masters
mingle in a harmonious whole; but all of us have it,
unless we are so deficient in imagination as to be less
than human. When we speak of a person as independent
of opinion, or self-sufficient, we can only
mean that, being of a constructive and stable character,
he does not have to recur every day to the
visible presence of his approvers, but can supply
their places by imagination, can hold on to some
influences and reject others, choose his leaders, individualize
his conformity; and so work out a characteristic
and fairly consistent career. The self
must be built up by the aid of social suggestions,
just as all higher thought is.</p>

<p class='c012'>Honor is a finer kind of self-respect. It is used to
mean either something one feels regarding himself,
or something that other people think and feel regarding
him, and so illustrates by the accepted use of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>language the fact that the private and social aspects
of self are inseparable. One’s honor, as he feels it,
and his honor in the sense of honorable repute, as he
conceives it to exist in the minds of others whose
opinion he cares for, are two aspects of the same
thing. No one can permanently maintain a standard
of honor in his own mind if he does not conceive of
some other mind or minds as sharing and corroborating
this standard. If his immediate environment
is degrading he may have resort to books or
memory in order that his imagination may construct
a better environment of nobler people to sustain his
standard; but if he cannot do this it is sure to fall.
Sentiments of higher good or right, like other sentiments,
find source and renewal in intercourse. On
the other hand, we cannot separate the idea of honor
from that of a sincere and stable private character.
We cannot form a habit of thought about what is
admirable, though it be derived from others, without
creating a mental standard. A healthy mind cannot
strive for outward honor without, in some measure,
developing an inward conscience—training himself
from the outside in, as Goethe says.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is the result of physiological theories of ethics—certainly
not intended by the authors of those
theories—to make the impulses of an ideal self, like
the sentiment of honor, seem far-fetched, extravagant
and irrational. They have to be justified by an elaborate
course of reasoning which does not seem very
convincing after all. No such impression, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>could result from the direct observation of social
life. In point of fact, a man’s honor, as he conceives
it, is his self in its most immediate and potent reality,
swaying his conduct without waiting upon any
inquiry into its physiological antecedents. The preference
of honor to life is not at all a romantic exception
in human behavior, but something quite
characteristic of man on a really human level. A
despicable or degenerate person may save his body
alive at the expense of honor, and so may almost
anyone in moments of panic or other kind of demoralization,
but the typical man, in his place
among his fellows and with his social sentiments
about him, will not do so. We read in history of
many peoples conquered because they lacked discipline
and strategy, or because their weapons were
inferior, but we seldom read of any who were really
cowardly in the sense that they would not face death
in battle. And the readiness to face death commonly
means that the sentiment of honor dominates the
impulses of terror and pain. All over the ancient
world the Roman legions encountered men who
shunned death no more than themselves, but were
not so skilful in inflicting it; and in Mexico and
Peru the natives died by thousands in a desperate
struggle against the Spanish arms. The earliest accounts
we have of our own Germanic ancestors show
a state of feeling and practice that made self-preservation,
in a material sense, strictly subordinate to
honor. “Death is better for every clansman than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>coward life,” says Beowulf,<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> and there seems no
doubt whatever that this was a general principle of
action, so that cowardice was a rare phenomenon.
In modern life we see the same subordination of
sensation to sentiment among soldiers and in a hundred
other careers involving bodily peril—not as a
heroic exception but as the ordinary practice of plain
men. We see it also in the general readiness to
undergo all sorts of sensual pains and privations
rather than cease to be respectable in the eyes of
other people. It is well known, for instance, that
among the poor thousands endure cold and partial
starvation rather than lose their self-respect by begging.
In short, it does not seem too favorable a
view of mankind to say that under normal conditions
their minds are ruled by the sentiment of Norfolk:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mine honor is my life: both grow in one;</div>
      <div class='line'>Take honor from me and my life is done.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>If we once grasp the fact that the self is primarily a
social, ideal, or imaginative fact, and not a sensual
fact, all this appears quite natural and not in need of
special explanation.</p>

<p class='c012'>In relation to the highest phases of individuality
self-respect becomes self-reverence, in the sense of
Tennyson, when he says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,</div>
      <div class='line'>These three alone lead life to sovereign power.”<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>or of Goethe when, in the first chapter of the second
book of “Wilhelm Meister’s Wanderjahre,” he names
self-reverence—<em>Ehrfurcht vor sick selbst</em>—as the highest
of the four reverences taught to youth in his
ideal system of education.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Emerson uses self-reliance
in a similar sense, in that memorable essay
the note of which is “Trust thyself, every heart
vibrates to that iron string,” and throughout his
works.</p>

<p class='c012'>Self-reverence, as I understand the matter, means
reverence for a higher or ideal self; a real “I,” because
it is based on what the individual actually is,
as only he himself can know and appropriate it, but
a better “I” of aspiration rather than attainment;
it is simply the best he can make out of life. Reverence
for it implies, as Emerson urges, resistance to
friends and counsellors and to any influence that the
mind honestly rejects as inconsistent with itself; a
man must feel that the final arbiter is within him
and not outside of him in some master, living or dead,
as conventional religion, for instance, necessarily
teaches. Nevertheless this highest self is a social
self, in that it is a product of constructive imagination
working with the materials which social experience
supplies. Our ideals of personal character
are built up out of thoughts and sentiments developed
by intercourse, and very largely by imagining
how our selves would appear in the minds of persons
we look up to. These are not necessarily living persons;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>anyone that is at all real, that is imaginable,
to us, becomes a possible occasion of social self-feeling;
and idealizing and aspiring persons live largely
in the imagined presence of masters and heroes to
whom they refer their own life for comment and improvement.
This is particularly true of youth, when
ideals are forming; later the personal element in
these ideals, having performed its function of suggesting
and vivifying them, is likely to fade out of
consciousness and leave only habits and principles
whose social origin is forgotten.</p>

<p class='c012'>Resentment, the attitude which an aggressive self
takes in response to imagined depreciation, may be
regarded as self-feeling with a coloring of anger; indeed,
the relation between self-feeling and particular
emotions like anger and fear is so close that the latter
might be looked upon as simply specialized kinds
of the former; it makes little difference whether we
take this view or think of them as distinct, since
such divisions must always be arbitrary. I shall say
more of this sentiment in the next chapter.</p>

<p class='c011'>If a person conceives his image as depreciated in
the mind of another; and if, instead of maintaining
an aggressive attitude and resenting that depreciation,
he yields to it and accepts the image and the
judgment upon it; then he feels and shows something
in the way of humility. Here again we have a great
variety of nomenclature, indicating different shades
of humble feeling and behavior, such as shame, confusion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>abasement, humiliation, mortification, meekness,
bashfulness, diffidence, shyness, being out of
countenance, abashed or crestfallen, contrition, compunction,
remorse, and so on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Humility, like self-approval, has forms that consist
with a high type of character and are felt to be
praiseworthy, and others that are felt to be base.
There is a sort that goes with vanity and indicates
instability, an excessive and indiscriminate yielding
to another’s view of one’s self. We wish a man to
be humble only before what, from his own characteristic
point of view, is truly superior. His humility
should imply self-respect; it should be that attitude
of deference which a stable but growing character
takes in the presence of whatever embodies its ideals.
Every outreaching person has masters in whose imagined
presence he drops resistance and becomes like
clay in the hands of the potter, that they may make
something better of him. He does this from a feeling
that the master is more himself than he is; there
is a receptive enthusiasm, a sense of new life that
swallows up the old self and makes his ordinary
personality appear tedious, base and despicable.
Humility of this sort goes with self-reverence, because
a sense of the higher or ideal self plunges the
present and commonplace self into humility. The
man aims at “so high an ideal that he always feels
his unworthiness in his own sight and that of others,
though aware of his own desert by the ordinary
standards of his community, country, or generation.”<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>But a humility that is self-abandonment,
a cringing before opinion alien to one’s self, is felt to
be mere cowardice and servility.</p>

<p class='c012'>Books of the inner life praise and enjoin lowliness,
contrition, repentance, self-abnegation; but it is apparent
to all thoughtful readers that the sort of
humility inculcated is quite consistent with the self-reverence
of Goethe or the self-reliance of Emerson—comes,
indeed, to much the same thing. The “Imitatio
Christi” is the type of such teaching, yet it is
a manly book, and the earlier part especially contains
exhortations to self-trust worthy of Emerson. “Certa
viriliter,” the writer says, “consuetudo consuetudine
vincitur. Si tu scis homines dimittere, ipsi bene te
dimittent tua facta facere.”<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> The yielding constantly
enjoined is either to God—that is, to an ideal
personality developed in one’s own mind—or, if to
men, it is a submission to external rule which is
designed to leave the will free for what are regarded
as its higher functions. The whole teaching tends to
the aggrandizement of an ideal but intensely private
self, worked out in solitary meditation—to insure
which worldly ambition is to be renounced—and
symbolized as God, conscience, or grace. The just
criticism of the doctrine that Thomas stands for is
not that it depreciates manhood and self-reliance, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>that it calls these away from the worldly activities
where they are so much needed, and exercises them
in a region of abstract imagination. No healthy
mind can cast out self-assertion and the idea of personal
freedom, however the form of expression may
seem to deny these things, and accordingly the Imitation,
and still more the New Testament, are full of
them. Where there is no self-feeling, no ambition of
any sort, there is no efficacy or significance. To
lose the sense of a separate, productive, resisting self,
would be to melt and merge and cease to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>Healthy, balanced minds, of only medium sensibility,
in a congenial environment and occupied
with wholesome activity, keep the middle road of
self-respect and reasonable ambition. They may
require no special effort, no conscious struggle with
recalcitrant egotism, to avoid heart-burning, jealousy,
arrogance, anxious running after approval, and
other maladies of the social self. With enough
self-feeling to stimulate and not enough to torment
him, with a social circle appreciative but not flattering,
with good health and moderate success, a man
may go through life with very little use for the moral
and religious weapons that have been wrought for the
repression of a contumacious self. There are many,
particularly in an active, hopeful, and materially
prosperous time like this, who have little experience
of inner conflict and no interest in the literature and
doctrine that relate to it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>But nearly all persons of the finer, more sensitive
sort find the social self at times a source of passion
and pain. In so far as a man amounts to anything,
stands for anything, is truly an individual, he has an
ego about which his passions cluster, and to aggrandize
which must be a principal aim with him. But
the very fact that the self is the object of our schemes
and endeavors makes it a centre of mental disturbance:
its suggestions are of effort, responsibility,
doubt, hope, and fear. Just as a man cannot enjoy
the grass and trees in his own grounds with quite
the peace and freedom that he can those abroad,
because they remind him of improvements that he
ought to make and the like; so any part of the self is,
in its nature, likely to be suggestive of exertion rather
than rest. Moreover, it would seem that self-feeling,
though pleasant in normal duration and intensity, is
disagreeable in excess, like any other sort of feeling.
One reason why we get tired of ourselves is simply
that we have exhausted our capacity for experiencing
with pleasure a certain kind of emotion.</p>

<p class='c012'>As we have seen, the self that is most importunate
is a reflection, largely, from the minds of others.
This phase of self is related to character very much
as credit is related to the gold and other securities
upon which it rests. It easily and willingly expands,
in most of us, and is liable to sudden, irrational, and
grievous collapses. We live on, cheerful, self-confident,
conscious of helping make the world go round,
until in some rude hour we learn that we do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>stand so well as we thought we did, that the image of
us is tarnished. Perhaps we do something, quite
naturally, that we find the social order is set against,
or perhaps it is the ordinary course of our life that is
not so well regarded as we supposed. At any rate,
we find with a chill of terror that the world is cold
and strange, and that our self-esteem, self-confidence,
and hope, being chiefly founded upon opinions,
attributed to others, go down in the crash. Our
reason may tell us that we are no less worthy than
we were before, but dread and doubt do not permit
us to believe it. The sensitive mind will certainly
suffer, because of the instability of opinion. <em>Cadit
cum labili.</em> As social beings we live with our eyes
upon our reflection, but have no assurance of the
tranquillity of the waters in which we see it. In the
days of witchcraft it used to be believed that if one
person secretly made a waxen image of another and
stuck pins into the image, its counterpart would
suffer tortures, and that if the image was melted the
person would die. This superstition is almost realized
in the relation between the private self and its social
reflection. They seem separate but are darkly united,
and what is done to the one is done to the other.</p>

<p class='c012'>If a person of energetic and fine-strung temperament
is neither vain nor proud, and lives equably
without suffering seriously from mortification, jealousy,
and the like; it is because he has in some way
learned to discipline and control his self-feeling, and
thus to escape the pains to which it makes him liable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>To effect some such escape has always been a present
and urgent problem with sensitive minds, and the literature
of the inner life is very largely a record of
struggle with the inordinate passions of the social
self. To the commoner and somewhat sluggish sorts
of people these passions are, on the whole, agreeable
and beneficent. Emulation, ambition, honor, even
pride and vanity in moderation, belong to the higher
and more imaginative parts of our thought; they
awaken us from sensuality and inspire us with ideal
and socially determined purposes. The doctrine that
they are evil could have originated only with those
who felt them so; that is, I take it, with unusually
sensitive spirits, or those whom circumstances denied
a normal and wholesome self-expression. To such
the thought of self becomes painful, not because of
any lack of self-feeling; but, quite the reverse, because,
being too sensitive and tender, it becomes overwrought,
so that this thought sets in vibration an
emotional chord already strained and in need of rest.
To such minds self-abnegation becomes an ideal, an
ideal of rest, peace and freedom, like green pastures
and still waters. The prophets of the inner life, like
Marcus Aurelius, St. Paul, St. Augustine, Thomas à
Kempis, and Pascal, were men distinguished not by
the lack of an aggressive self, but by a success in controlling
and elevating it which makes them the examples
of all who undergo a like struggle with it. If
their ego had not been naturally importunate they
would not have been forced to contend with it, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>develop the tactics of that contention for the edification
of times to come.</p>

<p class='c012'>The social self may be protected either in the negative
way, by some sort of withdrawal from the suggestions
that agitate and harass it, or in the positive
way, by contending with them and learning to control
and transform them, so that they are no longer painful;
most teachers inculcating some sort of a combination
of these two kinds of tactics.</p>

<p class='c011'>Physical withdrawal from the presence of men has
always been much in favor with those in search of a
calmer, surer life. The passions to be regulated are
sympathetic in origin, awakened by imagination of
the minds of other persons with whom we come in
contact. As Contarini Fleming remarks in Disraeli’s
novel, “So soon as I was among men I desired to influence
them.” To retire to the monastery, or the
woods, or the sea, is to escape from the sharp suggestions
that spur on ambition; and even to change
from the associates and competitors of our active life
into the company of strangers, or at least of those
whose aims and ambitions are different from ours, has
much the same effect. To get away from one’s working
environment is, in a sense, to get away from
one’s self; and this is often the chief advantage of
travel and change. I can hardly agree with those
who imagine that a special instinct of withdrawal is
necessary to explain the prominence of retirement in
the ordinances of religion. People wish to retire from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the world because they are weary, harassed, driven
by it, so that they feel that they cannot recover their
equanimity without getting away from it. To the impressible
mind life is a theatre of alarms and contentions,
even when a phlegmatic person can see no
cause for agitation—and to such a mind peace often
seems the one thing fair and desirable, so that the
cloister or the forest, or the vessel on the lonesome
sea, is the most grateful object of imagination. The
imaginative self, which is, for most purposes, the real
self, may be more battered, wounded and strained by a
striving, ambitious life than the material body could
be in a more visible battle, and its wounds are usually
more lasting and draw more deeply upon the vitality.
Mortification, resentment, jealousy, the fear of disgrace
and failure, sometimes even hope and elation,
are exhausting passions; and it is after a severe experience
of them that retirement seems most healing
and desirable.</p>

<p class='c012'>A subtler kind of withdrawal takes place in the
imagination alone by curtailing ambition, by trimming
down one’s idea of himself to a measure that
need not fear further diminution. How secure and
restful it would be if one could be consistently and
sincerely humble! There is no sweeter feeling than
contrition, self-abnegation, after a course of alternate
conceit and mortification. This also is an established
part of the religious discipline of the mind. Thus we
find the following in Thomas: “Son, now I will teach
thee the way of peace and of true liberty....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Study to do another’s will rather than thine own.
Choose ever to have less rather than more. Seek ever
the lower place and to be subject to all; ever wish
and pray that the will of God may be perfectly done
in thee and in all. Behold such a man enters the
bounds of peace and calm.”<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a> In other words, lop off
the aggressive social self altogether, renounce the
ordinary objects of ambition, accustom yourself to an
humble place in others’ thoughts, and you will be at
peace; because you will have nothing to lose, nothing
to fear. No one at all acquainted with the moralists,
pagan or Christian, will need to be more than reminded
that this imaginative withdrawal of the self
from strife and uncertainty has ever been inculcated
as a means to happiness and edification. Many persons
who are sensitive to the good opinion of others,
and, by impulse, take great pleasure in it, shrink from
indulging this pleasure because they know by experience
that it puts them into others’ power and introduces
an element of weakness, unrest, and probable
mortification. By recognizing a favorable opinion of
yourself, and taking pleasure in it, you in a measure
give yourself and your peace of mind into the keeping
of another, of whose attitude you can never be certain.
You have a new source of doubt and apprehension.
One learns in time the wisdom of entering into such
relations only with persons of whose sincerity, stability,
and justice one is as sure as possible; and also
of having nothing to do with approval of himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>which he does not feel to have a secure basis in his
character. And so regarding self-aggrandizement in
the various forms implicitly condemned by Thomas’s
four rules of peace; if a man is of so eager a temperament
that he does not need these motives to
awaken him and call his faculties into normal action,
he will be happier and possibly more useful to the
world if he is able to subdue them by some sort of
discipline. In this way, it seems to me, we may
chiefly account for and justify the stringent self-suppression
of Pascal and of many other fine spirits.
“So jealous was he of any surprise of pleasure, of
any thought of vanity or complacency in himself and
his work, that he wore a girdle of iron next his skin,
the sharp points of which he pressed closely when he
thought himself in any danger....”<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Of course the objection to withdrawal, physical
or imaginative, is that it seems to be a refusal of social
functions, a rejection of life, leading logically to
other-worldism, to the idea that it is better to die
than to live. According to this teaching, in its extreme
form, the best thing that can happen to a man
is to die and go to heaven; but if that is not permitted,
then let the private, ambitious self, set to play
the tunes of this world, die in him, and be replaced
by humble and secluded meditation in preparation
for the life to come. When this doctrine was taught
and believed to such an extent that a great part of
the finer spirits were led, during centuries, to isolate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>themselves in deserts and cloisters, or at least to
renounce and depreciate the affections and duties of
the family, the effect was no doubt bad; but in our
time there is little tendency to this extreme, and
there is perhaps danger that the usefulness of partial
or occasional withdrawal may be overlooked.
Mr. Lecky thinks, for instance, that the complete
suppression of the conventual system by Protestantism
has been far from a benefit to women or the
world, and that it is impossible to conceive of any
institution more needed than one which should furnish
a shelter for unprotected women and convert
them into agents of charity.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> The amount and kind
of social stimulation that a man can bear without
harm to his character and working power depends,
roughly speaking, upon his sensitiveness, which determines
the emotional disturbance, and upon the
vigor of the controlling or co-ordinating functions,
which measures his power to guide or quell emotion
and make it subsidiary to healthy life. There has
always been a class of persons, including a large
proportion of those capable of the higher sorts of
intellectual production, for whom the competitive
struggles of ordinary life are overstimulating and
destructive, and who therefore cannot serve the
world well without apparently secluding themselves
from it. It would seem, then, that withdrawal and
asceticism are often too sweepingly condemned. A
sound practical morality will consider these things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>in relation to various types of character and circumstance,
and find, I believe, important functions for
both.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the most radical remedy for the mortifications
and uncertainties of the social self is not the negative
one of merely secluding or diminishing the I, but
the positive one of transforming it. The two are not
easily distinguishable, and are usually phases of the
same process. The self-instinct, though it cannot be
suppressed while mental vigor remains, can be taught
to associate itself more and more with ideas and
aims of general and permanent worth, which can be
thought of as higher than the more sensual, narrow,
or temporary interests, and independent of them.
It must always be borne in mind that the self is any
idea or system of ideas with which is associated the
peculiar appropriative attitude we call self-feeling.
Anything whose depreciation makes me feel resentful
is myself, whether it is my coat, my face, my
brother, the book I have published, the scientific
theory I accept, the philanthropic work to which I
am devoted, my religious creed, or my country. The
only question is, Am I identified with it in my
thought, so that to touch it is to touch me? Thus
in “Middlemarch” the true self of Mr. Casaubon, his
most aggressive, persistent, and sensitive part, is his
system of ideas relating to the unpublished “Key to
All Mythologies.” It is about this that he is proud,
jealous, sore, and apprehensive. What he imagines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>that the Brasenose men will think of it is a large
part of his social self, and he suffers hidden joy and
torture according as he is hopeful or despondent of
its triumphant publication. When he finds that his
body must die his chief thought is how to keep this
alive, and he attempts to impose its completion upon
poor Dorothea, who is a pale shadow in his life compared
with the Key, a mere instrument to minister
to this fantastic ego. So if one, turning the leaves
of history, could evoke the real selves of all the men
of thought, what a strange procession they would be!—outlandish
theories, unintelligible and forgotten
creeds, hypotheses once despised but now long established,
or <em>vice versa</em>—all conceived eagerly, jealously,
devotedly, as the very heart of the self. There
is no class more sensitive and none, not even the insane,
in whom self-feeling attaches to such singular
and remote conceptions. An astronomer may be indifferent
when you depreciate his personal appearance,
abuse his relatives, or question his pecuniary
honesty; but if you doubt that there are artificial
canals on Mars you cut him to the quick. And poets
and artists of every sort have always and with good
reason been regarded as a <em>genus irritabile</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ideas of self most commonly cherished, and
the ambitions corresponding to these ideas, fail to
appease the imagination of the idealist, for various
reasons; chiefly, perhaps, for the following: first because
they seem more or less at variance with the
good of other persons, and so, to the imaginative and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>sympathetic mind, bring elements of inconsistency
and wrong, which it cannot accept as consonant with
its own needs; and second because their objects are
at best temporary, so that even if thought of as
achieved they fail to meet the need of the mind for
a resting-place in some conception of permanent
good or right. The transformation of narrow and
temporary ambitions or ideals into something more
fitted to satisfy the imagination in these respects, is
an urgent need, a condition precedent to peace of
mind, in many persons. The unquiet and discordant
state of the unregenerate is a commonplace, a
thousand times repeated, of writings on the inner
life. “<em>Superbus et avarus numquam quiescunt</em>,” they
tell us, and to enable us to escape from such unrest
is a chief aim of the discipline of self-feeling
enjoined by ethical and religious teachers. “Self,”
“the natural man,” and similar expressions indicate
an aspect of the self thought of as lower—in part at
least because of the insecure, inconsistent, and temporary
character just indicated—which is to be so
far as possible subjected and forgotten, while the
feelings once attached to it find a less precarious
object in ideas of justice and right, or in the conception
of a personal deity, in whom all that is best of
personality is to have secure existence and eternal
success.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this sense also we may understand the idea of
freedom as it presented itself to Thomas à Kempis
and similar minds. To forget “self” and live the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>larger life is to be free; free, that is, from the racking
passions of the lower self, free to go onward into
a self that is joyful, boundless, and without remorse.
To gain this freedom the principal means is the control
or mortification of sensual needs and worldly
ambitions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the passion of self-aggrandizement is persistent
but plastic; it will never disappear from
a vigorous mind, but may become morally higher by
attaching itself to a larger conception of what constitutes
the self.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wherever men find themselves out of joint with
their social environment the fact will be reflected in
some peculiarity of self-feeling. Thus it was in times
when the general state of Europe was decadent and
hopeless, or later when ceaseless wars and the common
rule of violence prevailed, that finer spirits, for
whose ambition the times offered no congenial career,
so largely sought refuge in religious seclusion, and
there built up among themselves a philosophy which
compensated them by the vision of glory in another
world for their insignificance in this. An institution
so popular and enduring as monasticism and the
system of belief that throve in connection with it
must have answered to some deep need of human
nature, and it would seem that, as regarded the more
intellectual class, this need was largely that of creating
a social self and system of selves which could thrive
in the actual state of things. Their natures craved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>success, and, following a tendency always at work,
though never more fantastic in its operation, they
created an ideal or standard of success which they
could achieve—very much as a farmer’s boy with a
weak body but an active brain sometimes goes into
law, seeking and upholding an intellectual type of
success. From this point of view—which is, of course,
only one of many whence monasticism may be regarded—it
appears as a wonderful exhibition of the
power of human nature to effectuate itself in a co-operative
manner in spite of the most untoward
external circumstances.</p>

<p class='c012'>If we have less flight from the world, corporeal or
metaphysical, at the present day, it is doubtless in
part because the times are more hospitable to the
finer abilities, so that all sorts of men, within wide
limits, find careers in which they may hope to gratify
a reasonable ambition. But even now, where conditions
are deranged and somewhat anarchical, so
that many find themselves cut off from the outlook
toward a congenial self-development, the wine of life
turns bitter, and harrying resentments are generated
which more or less disturb the stability of the social
order. Each man must have his “I”; it is more
necessary to him than bread; and if he does not find
scope for it within the existing institutions he will
be likely to make trouble.</p>

<p class='c012'>Persons of great ambitions, or of peculiar aims of
any sort, lie open to disorders of self-feeling, because
they necessarily build up in their minds a self-image
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>which no ordinary social environment can understand
or corroborate, and which must be maintained by hardening
themselves against immediate influences, enduring
or repressing the pains of present depreciation,
and cultivating in imagination the approval of some
higher tribunal. If the man succeeds in becoming
indifferent to the opinions of his neighbors he runs
into another danger, that of a distorted and extravagant
self of the pride sort, since by the very process
of gaining independence and immunity from the
stings of depreciation and misunderstanding, he has
perhaps lost that wholesome deference to some social
tribunal that a man cannot dispense with and remain
quite sane. The image lacks verification and correction
and becomes too much the reflection of an undisciplined
self-feeling. It would seem that the
megalomania or delusion of greatness which Lombroso,
with more or less plausibility, ascribes to
Victor Hugo and many other men of genius, is to be
explained largely in this way.</p>

<p class='c012'>Much the same may be said regarding the relation
of self-feeling to mental disorder, and to abnormal
personality of all sorts. It seems obvious, for instance,
that the delusions of greatness and delusions
of persecution so common in insanity are expressions
of self-feeling escaped from normal limitation and
control. The instinct which under proper regulation
by reason and sympathy gives rise to just and sane
ambition, in the absence of it swells to grotesque
proportions; while the delusion of persecution appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>to be a like extravagant development of that
jealousy regarding what others are thinking of us
which often reaches an almost insane point in irritable
people whose sanity is not questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>The peculiar relations to other persons attending
any marked personal deficiency or peculiarity are
likely to aggravate, if not to produce, abnormal
manifestations of self-feeling. Any such trait sufficiently
noticeable to interrupt easy and familiar
intercourse with others, and make people talk and
think <em>about</em> a person or <em>to</em> him rather than <em>with</em> him,
can hardly fail to have this effect. If he is naturally
inclined to pride or irritability, these tendencies,
which depend for correction upon the flow of sympathy,
are likely to be increased. One who shows
signs of mental aberration is, inevitably perhaps, but
cruelly, shut off from familiar, thoughtless intercourse,
partly excommunicated; his isolation is unwittingly
proclaimed to him on every countenance by curiosity,
indifference, aversion or pity, and in so far as
he is human enough to need free and equal communication
and feel the lack of it, he suffers pain
and loss of a kind and degree which others can only
faintly imagine, and for the most part ignore. He
finds himself apart, “not in it,” and feels chilled,
fearful, and suspicious. Thus “queerness” is no
sooner perceived than it is multiplied by reflection
from other minds. The same is true in some degree
of dwarfs, deformed or disfigured persons, even the
deaf and those suffering from the infirmities of old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>age. The chief misery of the decline of the faculties,
and a main cause of the irritability that often goes
with it, is evidently the isolation, the lack of customary
appreciation and influence, which only the rarest
tact and thoughtfulness on the part of others can
alleviate.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Simple or Animal Anger—Social Anger—The Function of
Hostility—The Doctrine of Non-resistance—Control and
Transformation of Hostility by Reason—Hostility as
Pleasure or Pain—The Importance of Accepted Social
Standards—Fear.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>Anger, like other emotions, seems to exist at birth
as a simple, instinctive animal tendency, and to undergo
differentiation and development parallel with
the growth of imagination. Perez, speaking of children
at about the age of two months, says, “they
begin to push away objects that they do not like, and
have real fits of passion, frowning, growing red in the
face, trembling all over, and sometimes shedding
tears.” They also show anger at not getting the
breast or bottle, or when washed or undressed, or
when their toys are taken away. At about one year old
“they will beat people, animals, and inanimate objects
if they are angry with them,”<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> throw things at
offending persons, and the like.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have observed phenomena similar to these, and
no doubt all have who have seen anything of little
children. If there are any writers who tend to
regard the mind at birth as almost <em>tabula rasa</em> so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>as special instincts are concerned, consisting of little
more than a faculty of receiving and organizing
impressions, it must be wholesome for them to associate
with infants and notice how unmistakable are
the signs of a distinct and often violent emotion,
apparently identical with the anger or rage of adults.
What grown-up persons feel seems to be different, not
in its emotional essence, but in being modified by association
with a much more complicated system of ideas.</p>

<p class='c012'>This simple, animal sort of anger, excited immediately
by something obnoxious to the senses, does not
entirely disappear in adult life. Probably most persons
who step upon a barrel-hoop or run their heads
against a low doorway can discern a moment of
instinctive anger toward the harming object. Even
our more enduring forms of hostility seem often to
partake of this direct, unintellectual character. Most
people, but especially those of a sensitive, impressible
nature, have antipathies to places, animals, persons,
words—to all sorts of things in fact—which
appear to spring directly out of the subconscious
life, without any mediation of thought. Some think
that an animal or instinctive antipathy to human
beings of a different race is natural to all mankind.
And among people of the same race there are undoubtedly
persons whom other persons loathe without
attributing to them any hostile state of mind, but
with a merely animal repugnance. Even when the
object of hostility is quite distinctly a mental or
moral trait, we often seem to feel it in an external
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>way, that is, we <em>see</em> it as behavior but do not really
understand it as thought or sentiment. Thus duplicity
is hateful whether we can see any motive for it
or not, and gives a sense of slipperiness and insecurity
so tangible that one naturally thinks of some
wriggling animal. In like manner vacillation, fawning,
excessive protestation or self-depreciation, and
many other traits, may be obnoxious to us in a somewhat
physical way without our imagining them as
states of mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>But for a social, imaginative being, whose main
interests are in the region of communicative thought
and sentiment, the chief field of anger, as of other
emotions, is transferred to this region. Hostility
ceases to be a simple emotion due to a simple stimulus,
and breaks up into innumerable hostile sentiments
associated with highly imaginative personal ideas.
In this mentally higher form it may be regarded as
hostile sympathy, or a hostile comment on sympathy.
That is to say, we enter by sympathy or personal
imagination into the state of mind of others, or think
we do, and if the thoughts we find there are injurious
to or uncongenial with the ideas we are already
cherishing, we feel a movement of anger.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is forcibly expressed in a brief but admirable
study of antipathy by Sophie Bryant. Though the
antipathy she describes is of a peculiarly subtle kind,
it is plain that the same sort of analysis may be
applied to any form of imaginative hostility.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“A is drawn out toward B to feel what he feels.
If the new feeling harmonizes, distinctly or obscurely,
with the whole system of A’s consciousness—or the
part then identified with his will—there follows that
joyful expansion of self beyond self which is sympathy.
But if not—if the new feeling is out of keeping
with the system of A’s will—tends to upset the
system, and brings discord into it—there follows the
reaction of the whole against the hostile part which,
transferred to its cause in B, pushes out B’s state, as
the antithesis of self, yet threatening self, and offensive.”
Antipathy, she says, “is full of horrid thrill.”
“The peculiar horror of the antipathy springs from
the unwilling response to the state abhorred. We
feel ourselves actually like the other person, selfishly
vain, cruelly masterful, artfully affected, insincere,
ungenial, and so on.”... “There is some affinity
between those who antipathize.”<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> And with
similar meaning Thoreau remarks that “you cannot
receive a shock unless you have an electric affinity
for that which shocks you,” and that “He who receives
an injury is to some extent an accomplice of
the wrong-doer.”<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the cause of hostility is imaginative or sympathetic,
an inimical idea attributed to another mind.
We cannot feel this way toward that which is totally
unlike us, because the totally unlike is unimaginable,
has no interest for us. This, like all social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>feeling, requires a union of likeness with difference.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is clear that closer association, and more knowledge
of one another, offer no security against hostile
feeling. Whether intimacy will improve our sentiment
toward another man or not depends upon
the true relation of his way of thinking and feeling
to ours, which intimacy is likely to reveal. There
are many persons with whom we get on very well at
a certain distance, who would turn out intensely antipathetic
if we had to live in the same house with
them. Probably all of us have experienced in one
form or another the disgust and irritation that may
come from enforced intimacy with people we liked
well enough as mere acquaintances, and with whom
we can find no particular fault, except that they
rub us the wrong way. Henry James, speaking of
the aversion of the brothers Goncourt for Saint
Beuve, remarks that it was “a plant watered by frequent
intercourse and protected by punctual notes.”<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
It is true that an active sense of justice may do
much to overcome unreasonable antipathies; but
there are so many urgent uses for our sense of justice
that it is well not to fatigue it by excessive and
unnecessary activity. Justice involves a strenuous
and symmetrical exercise of the imagination and reason,
which no one can keep up all the time; and
those who display it most on important occasions
ought to be free to indulge somewhat their whims
and prejudices in familiar intercourse.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Neither do refinement, culture, and taste have any
necessary tendency to diminish hostility. They make
a richer and finer sympathy possible, but at the same
time multiply the possible occasions of antipathy.
They are like a delicate sense of smell, which opens
the way to as much disgust as appreciation. Instead
of the most sensitive sympathy, the finest mental
texture, being a safeguard against hostile passions,
it is only too evident from a study of the lives
of men of genius that these very traits make a sane
and equable existence peculiarly difficult. Read, for
instance, the confessions of Rousseau, and observe
how a fine nature, full of genuine and eager social
idealism, is subject to peculiar sufferings and errors
through the sensibility and imagination such a nature
must possess. The quicker the sympathy and ideality,
the greater the suffering from neglect and failure,
the greater also the difficulty of disciplining the multitude
of intense impressions and maintaining a sane
view of the whole. Hence the pessimism, the extravagant
indignation against real or supposed wrong-doers,
and not infrequently, as in Rousseau’s case,
the almost insane bitterness of jealousy and mistrust.</p>

<p class='c012'>The commonest forms of imaginative hostility are
grounded on social self-feeling, and come under the
head of resentment. We impute to the other person
an injurious thought regarding something which
we cherish as a part of our self, and this awakens
anger, which we name pique, animosity, umbrage,
estrangement, soreness, bitterness, heart-burning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>jealousy, indignation, and so on; in accordance with
variations which these words suggest. They all rest
upon a feeling that the other person harbors ideas
injurious to us, so that the thought of him is an attack
upon our self. Suppose, for instance, there is
a person who has reason to believe that he has caught
me in a lie. It makes little difference, perhaps,
whether he really has or not; so long as I have any
self-respect left, and believe that he entertains this
depreciatory idea of me, I must resent this idea whenever,
through my thinking of him, it enters my mind.
Or suppose there is a man who has met me running
in panic from the field of battle; would it not be
hard not to hate him? These situations are perhaps
unusual, but we all know persons to whom we attribute
depreciation of our characters, our friends, our
children, our workmanship, our cherished creed or
philanthropy; and we do not like them.</p>

<p class='c012'>The resentment of charity or pity is a good instance
of hostile sympathy. If a man has self-respect,
he feels insulted by the depreciating view of
his manhood implied in commiserating him or offering
him alms. Self-respect means that one’s reflected
self is up to the social standard: and the social standard
requires that a man should not need pity or alms
except under very unusual conditions. So the assumption
that he does need them is an injury—whether
he does or not—precisely as it is an insult to a
woman to commiserate her ugliness and bad taste,
and suggest that she wear a veil or employ someone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>to select her gowns. The curious may find interest
in questions like this: whether a tramp can have self-respect
unless he deceives the one who gives him aid,
and so feels superior to him, and not a mere dependent.
In the same way we can easily see why criminals
look down upon paupers.</p>

<p class='c012'>The word indignation suggests a higher sort of
imaginative hostility. It implies that the feeling is
directed toward some attack upon a standard of right,
and is not merely an impulse like jealousy or pique.
A higher degree of rationalization is involved; there
is some notion of a reasonable adjustment of personal
claims, which the act or thought in question violates.
We frequently perceive that the simpler forms of
resentment have no rational basis, could not be justified
in open court, but indignation always claims a
general or social foundation. We feel indignant when
we think that favoritism and not merit secures promotion,
when the rich man gets a pass on the railroad,
and so on.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is thus possible rudely to classify hostilities
under three heads, according to the degree of mental
organization they involve; namely, as</p>

<p class='c012'>1. Primary, immediate, or animal.</p>

<p class='c012'>2. Social, sympathetic, imaginative, or personal, of
a comparatively direct sort, that is, without reference
to any standard of justice.</p>

<p class='c012'>3. Rational or ethical; similar to the last but involving
reference to a standard of justice and the
sanction of conscience.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The function of hostility is, no doubt, to awaken a
fighting energy, to contribute an emotional motive
force to activities of self-preservation or aggrandizement.</p>

<p class='c012'>In its immediate or animal form this is obvious
enough. The wave of passion that possesses a fighting
dog stimulates and concentrates his energy upon
a few moments of struggle in which success or failure
may be life or death; and the simple, violent anger
of children and impulsive adults is evidently much
the same thing. Vital force explodes in a flash of
aggression; the mind has no room for anything but
the fierce instinct. It is clear that hostility of this
uncontrolled sort is proper to a very simple state of
society and of warfare, and is likely to be a source of
disturbance and weakness in that organized state
which calls for corresponding organization in the
individual mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a transition by imperceptible degrees
from the blind anger that thinks of nothing to the
imaginative anger that thinks of persons, and pursues
the personal idea into all possible degrees of subtlety
and variety. The passion itself, the way we feel
when we are angry, does not seem to change much,
except, perhaps, in intensity, the change being mostly
in the idea that awakens it. It is as if anger were a
strong and peculiar flavor which might be taken with
the simplest food or the most elaborate, might be
used alone, strong and plain, or in the most curious
and recondite combinations with other flavors.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>While it is evident enough that animal anger is one
of those instincts that are readily explained as conducive
to self-preservation, it is not, perhaps, so
obvious that socialized anger has any such justification.
I think, however, that, though very liable to
be excessive and unmanageable, and tending continually
to be economized as the race progresses,
so that most forms of it are properly regarded as
wrong, it nevertheless plays an indispensable part
in life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The mass of mankind are sluggish and need some
resentment as a stimulant; this is its function on the
higher plane of life as it is on the lower. Surround
a man with soothing, flattering circumstances, and in
nine cases out of ten he will fail to do anything
worthy, but will lapse into some form of sensualism
or dilettanteism. There is no tonic, to a nature substantial
enough to bear it, like chagrin—“erquickender
Verdruss,” as Goethe says. Life without opposition
is Capua. No matter what the part one is fitted to
play in it, he can make progress in his path only
by a vigorous assault upon the obstacles, and to be
vigorous the assault must be supported by passion
of some sort. With most of us the requisite intensity
of passion is not forthcoming without an element of
resentment; and common-sense and careful observation
will, I believe, confirm the opinion that few people
who amount to much are without a good capacity
for hostile feeling, upon which they draw freely when
they need it. This would be more readily admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>if many people were not without the habit of penetrating
observation, either of themselves or others, in
such matters, and so are enabled to believe that
anger, which is conventionally held to be wrong, has
no place in the motives of moral persons.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have in mind a man who is remarkable for a certain
kind of aggressive, tenacious and successful pursuit
of the right. He does the things that everyone
else agrees ought to be done but does not do—especially
things involving personal antagonism.
While the other people deplore the corruption of
politics, but have no stomach to amend it, he is the
man to beard the corrupt official in his ward, or
expose him in the courts or the public press—all at
much pains and cost to himself and without prospect
of honor or any other recompense. If one considers
how he differs from other conscientious people of
equal ability and opportunity, it appears to be largely
in having more bile in him. He has a natural fund
of animosity, and instead of spending it blindly and
harmfully, he directs it upon that which is hateful to
the general good, thus gratifying his native turn for
resentment in a moral and fruitful way. Evidently
if there were more men of this stamp it would be
of benefit to the moral condition of the country.
Contemporary conditions seem to tend somewhat to
dissipate that righteous wrath against evil which,
intelligently directed, is a main instrument of progress.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thomas Huxley, to take a name known to all, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>a man in whom there was much fruitful hostility.
He did not seek controversy, but when the enemies
of truth offered battle he felt no inclination to refuse;
and he avowed—perhaps with a certain zest in contravening
conventional teaching—that he loved his
friends and hated his enemies.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a> His hatred was of
a noble sort, and the reader of his Life and Letters
can hardly doubt that he was a good as well as a
great man, or that his pugnacity helped him to be
such. Indeed I do not think that science or letters
could do without the spirit of opposition, although
much energy is dissipated and much thought clouded
by it. Even men like Darwin or Emerson, who
seem to wish nothing more than to live at peace with
everyone, may be observed to develop their views
with unusual fulness and vigor where they are most
in opposition to authority. There is something analogous
to political parties in all intellectual activity;
opinion divides, more or less definitely, into opposing
groups, and each side is stimulated by the opposition
of the other to define, corroborate, and amend
its views, with the purpose of justifying itself before
the constituency to which it appeals. What we need
is not that controversy should disappear, but that it
should be carried on with sincere and absolute deference
to the standard of truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>A just resentment is not only a needful stimulus
to aggressive righteousness, but has also a wholesome
effect upon the mind of the person against whom it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>directed, by awakening a feeling of the importance of
the sentiments he has transgressed. On the higher
planes of life an imaginative sense that there is resentment
in the minds of other persons performs the
same function that physical resistance does upon the
lower.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> It is an attack upon my mental self, and as
a sympathetic and imaginative being I feel it more
than I would a mere blow; it forces me to consider
the other’s view, and either to accept it or to bear it
down by the stronger claims of a different one. Thus
it enters potently into our moral judgments.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let such pure hate still underprop</div>
      <div class='line'>Our love that we may be</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>I think that no one’s character and aims can be
respected unless he is perceived to be capable of
some sort of resentment. We feel that if he is really
in earnest about anything he should feel hostile
emotion if it is attacked, and if he gives no sign of
this, either at the moment of attack or later, he and
what he represents become despised. No teacher,
for instance, can maintain discipline unless his
scholars feel that he will in some manner resent a
breach of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus we seldom feel keenly that our acts are
wrong until we perceive that they arouse some sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>of resentment in others, and whatever selfish aggression
we can practise without arousing resistance, we
presently come to look upon as a matter of course.
Judging the matter from my own consciousness and
experience, I have no belief in the theory that non-resistance
has, as a rule, a mollifying influence upon
the aggressor. I do not wish people to turn me the
other cheek when I smite them, because, in most
cases, that has a bad effect upon me. I am soon
used to submission and may come to think no more
of the unresisting sufferer than I do of the sheep
whose flesh I eat at dinner. Neither, on the other
hand, am I helped by extravagant and accusatory
opposition; that is likely to put me into a state of
unreasoning anger. But it is good for us that everyone
should maintain his rights, and the rights of
others with whom he sympathizes, exhibiting a just
and firm resentment against any attempt to tread
upon them. A consciousness, based on experience,
that the transgression of moral standards will arouse
resentment in the minds of those whose opinion we
respect, is a main force in the upholding of such
standards.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the doctrine of non-resistance, like all ideas
that have appealed to good minds, has a truth
wrapped up in it, notwithstanding what appears to
be its flagrant absurdity. What the doctrine really
means, as taught in the New Testament and by many
individuals and societies in our own day, is perhaps
no more than this, that we should discard the coarser
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>weapons of resistance for the finer, and threaten a
moral resentment instead of blows or lawsuits. It
is quite true that we can best combat what we regard
as evil in another person of ordinary sensibility by
attacking the higher phases of his self rather than the
lower. If a man appears to be about to do something
brutal or dishonest, we may either encounter him on
his present low plane of life by knocking him down
or calling a policeman, or we may try to work upon
his higher consciousness by giving him to understand
that we feel sure a person of his self-respect
and good repute will not degrade himself, but that if
anything so improbable and untoward should occur,
he must, of course, expect the disappointment and
contempt of those who before thought well of him.
In other words, we threaten, as courteously as possible,
his social self. This method is often much
more efficient than the other, is morally edifying instead
of degrading, and is practised by men of address
who make no claim to unusual virtue.</p>

<p class='c012'>This seems to be what is meant by non-resistance;
but the name is misleading. It <em>is</em> resistance, and directed
at what is believed to be the enemy’s weakest
point. As a matter of strategy it is an attack upon
his flank, aggression upon an unprotected part of his
position. Its justification, in the long run, is in its
success. If we do not succeed in making our way
into the other man’s mind and changing his point
of view by substituting our own, the whole manœuvre
falls flat, the injury is done, the ill-doer is confirmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>in his courses, and you would better have knocked
him down. It is good to appeal to the highest
motives we can arouse, and to exercise a good deal
of faith as to what can be aroused, but real non-resistance
to what we believe to be wrong is mere
pusillanimity. There is perhaps no important sect
or teacher that really inculcates such a doctrine,
the name non-resistance being given to attacks
upon the higher self under the somewhat crude
impression that resistance is not such unless it
takes some obvious material form, and probably all
teachers would be found to vary their tactics somewhat
according to the sort of people with whom they
are dealing. Although Christ taught the turning of
the other cheek to the smiter, and that the coat
should follow the cloak, it does not appear that he
suggested to those who were desecrating the Temple
that they should double their transactions, but, apparently
regarding them as beyond the reach of moral
suasion, he “went into the Temple, and began to cast
out them that sold and bought in the Temple, and
overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the
seats of them that sold doves.” It seems that he
even used a scourge on this occasion. I cannot see
much in the question regarding non-resistance beyond
a vague use of terms and a difference of opinion as to
what kind of resistance is most effective in certain
cases.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is easy and not uncommon to state too exclusively
the pre-eminence of affection in human ideals.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>No one, I suppose, believes that the life of Fra Angelico’s
angels, such as we see them in his “Last
Judgment,” circling on the flowery sward of Paradise,
would long content any normal human creature. If
it appears beautiful and desirable at times, this is
perhaps because our world is one in which the supply
of amity and peace mostly falls short of the demand
for them. Many of us have seen times of heat and
thirst when it seemed as if a bit of shade and a
draught of cold water would appease all earthly wants.
But when we had the shade and the water we presently
began to think about something else. So with
these ideals of unbroken peace and affection. Even for
those sensitive spirits that most cherish them, they
would hardly suffice as a continuity. An indiscriminate
and unvarying amity is, after all, disgusting.</p>

<p class='c012'>Human ideals and human nature must develop
together, and we cannot foresee what either may
become; but for the present it would seem that an
honest and reasonable idealism must look rather
to the organization and control of all passions with
reference to some conception of right, than to the expulsion
of some passions by others. I doubt whether
any healthy and productive love can exist which is
not resentment on its obverse side. How can we
rightly care for anything without in some way resenting
attacks upon it?</p>

<p class='c011'>Apparently, the higher function of hostility is to
put down wrong; and to fulfil this function it must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>be rationally controlled with a view to ideals of
justice. In so far as a man has a sound and active
social imagination, he will feel the need of this control,
and will tend with more or less energy, according
to the vigor of his mind, to limit his resentment
to that which his judgment tells him is really unjust
or wrong. Imagination presents us with all sorts
of conflicting views, which reason, whose essence is
organization, tries to arrange and control in accordance
with some unifying principle, some standard
of equity: moral principles result from the mind’s
instinctive need to achieve unity of view. All special
impulses, and hostile feeling among them, are brought
to the bar of conscience and judged by such standards
as the mind has worked out. If declared right
or justifiable, resentment is endorsed and enforced
by the will; we think of it as righteous and perhaps
take credit with ourselves for it. But if it appears
grounded on no broad and unifying principle, our
larger thought disowns it, and tends with such energy
as it may have to ignore and suppress it. Thus we
overlook accidental injury, we control or avoid mere
antipathy, but we act upon indignation. The latter
is enduring and powerful because consistent with
cool thought; while impulsive, unreasoning anger,
getting no re-enforcement from such thought, has
little lasting force.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suppose, for illustration, one goes with a request
to some person in authority, and meets a curt refusal.
The first feeling is doubtless one of blind, unthinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>anger at the rebuff. Immediately after that the
mind busies itself more deeply with the matter,
imagining motives, ascribing feelings and the like;
and anger takes a more bitter and personal form, it
rankles where at first it only stung. But if one is a
fairly reasonable man, accustomed to refer things to
standards of right, one presently grows calmer and,
continuing the imaginative process in a broader way,
endeavors to put himself at the other person’s
point of view and see what justification, if any, there
is for the latter’s conduct. Possibly he is one subject
to constant solicitation, with whom coldness and
abruptness are necessary to the despatch of business—and
so on. If the explanation seems insufficient,
so that his rudeness still appears to be mere insolence,
our resentment against him lasts, reappearing whenever
we think of him, so that we are likely to thwart
him somehow if we get a chance, and justify our
action to ourselves and others on grounds of moral
disapproval.</p>

<p class='c012'>Or suppose one has to stand in line at the postoffice,
with a crowd of other people, waiting to get his
mail. There are delay and discomfort to be borne;
but these he will take with composure because he sees
that they are a part of the necessary conditions of the
situation, which all must submit to alike. Suppose,
however, that while patiently waiting his turn he
notices someone else, who has come in later, edging
into the line ahead of him. Then he will certainly be
angry. The delay threatened is only a matter of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>few seconds; but here is a question of justice, a case
for indignation, a chance for anger to come forth with
the sanction of thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another phase of the transformation of hostility by
reason and imagination, is that it tends to become
more discriminating or selective as regards its relation
to the idea of the person against whom it is directed.
In a sense the higher hostility is less personal than
the lower; that is, in the sense that it is no longer
aimed blindly at persons as wholes, but distinguishes
in some measure between phases or tendencies of
them that are obnoxious and others that are not. It
is not the mere thought of X’s countenance, or other
symbol, that arouses resentment, but the thought of
him as exhibiting insincerity, or arrogance, or whatever
else it may be that we do not like; while we may
preserve a liking for him as exhibiting other traits.
Generally speaking, all persons have much in them
which, if imagined, must appear amiable; so that if
we feel only animosity toward a man it must be because
we have apprehended him only in a partial
aspect. An undisciplined anger, like any other undisciplined
emotion, always tends to produce these
partial and indiscriminate notions, because it overwhelms
symmetrical thought and permits us to see
only that which agrees with itself. But a more chastened
sentiment allows a juster view, so that it becomes
conceivable that we should love our enemies as well
as antagonize the faults of our friends. A just parent
or teacher will resent the insubordinate behavior of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>child or pupil without letting go of affection, and the
same principle holds good as regards criminals, and
all proper objects of hostility. The attitude of
society toward its delinquent members should be
stern, yet sympathetic, like that of a father toward
a disobedient child.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is the tendency of modern life, by educating the
imagination and rendering all sorts of people conceivable,
to discredit the sweeping conclusions of
impulsive thought—as, for instance, that all who
commit violence or theft are hateful ill-doers, and
nothing more—and to make us feel the fundamental
likeness of human nature wherever found. Resentment
against ill-doing should by no means disappear;
but while continuing to suppress wrong by whatever
means proves most efficacious, we shall perhaps see
more and more clearly that the people who are guilty
of it are very much like ourselves, and are acting
from motives to which we also are subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is often asserted or assumed that hostile feeling
is in its very nature obnoxious and painful to the
human mind, and persists in spite of us, as it were,
because it is forced upon us by the competitive conditions
of existence. This view seems to me hardly
sound. I should rather say that the mental and
social harmfulness of anger, in common experience, is
due not so much to its peculiar character as hostile
feeling, as to the fact that, like lust, it is so surcharged
with instinctive energy as to be difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>control and limit to its proper function; while, if not
properly disciplined, it of course introduces disorder
and pain into the mental life.</p>

<p class='c012'>To a person in robust condition, with plenty of
energy to spare, a thorough-going anger, far from
being painful, is an expansive, I might say glorious,
experience, <em>while the fit is on and has full control</em>. A
man in a rage does not want to get out of it, but has
a full sense of life which he impulsively seeks to continue
by repelling suggestions tending to calm him.
It is only when it has begun to pall upon him that he
is really willing to be appeased. This may be seen
by observing the behavior of impulsive children,
and also of adults whose passions are undisciplined.</p>

<p class='c012'>An enduring hatred may also be a source of satisfaction
to some minds, though this I believe to be
unusual in these days, and becoming more so. One
who reads Hazlitt’s powerful and sincere, though perhaps
unhealthy, essay on the Pleasure of Hating,
will see that the thing is possible. In most cases
remorse and distress set in so soon as the fit of anger
begins to abate, and its destructive incompatibility
with the established order and harmony of the mind
begins to be felt. There is a conviction of sin, the
pain of a shattered ideal, just as there is after yielding
to any other unchastened passion. The cause of
the pain seems to be not so much the peculiar character
of the feeling as its exorbitant intensity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Any simple and violent passion is likely to be felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>as painful and wrong in its after-effects because it
destroys that harmony or synthesis that reason and
conscience strive to produce; and this effect is probably
more and more felt as the race advances and
mental life becomes more complex. The conditions
of civilization require of us so extensive and continuous
an expenditure of psychical force, that we no longer
have the superabundance of emotional energy that
makes a violent outlet agreeable. Habits and principles
of self-control naturally arise along with the
increasing need for economy and rational guidance of
emotion; and whatever breaks through them causes
exhaustion and remorse. Any gross passion comes
to be felt as “the expense of spirit in a waste of
shame.” Spasms of violent feeling properly belong
with a somewhat apathetic habit of life, whose accumulating
energies they help to dissipate, and are as
much out of place to-day as the hard-drinking habits
of our Saxon ancestors.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sort of men that most feel the need of hostility
as a spur to exertion are, I imagine, those of superabundant
vitality and somewhat sluggish temperament,
like Goethe and Bismarck, both of whom declared
that it was essential to them. There is also
a great deal of old-fashioned personal hatred in remote
and quiet places, like the mountains of North
Carolina, and probably among all classes who do
not much feel the stress of civilization. But to
most of those who share fully in the life of the
time, intense personal animosities are painful and destructive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>and many fine spirits are ruined by failure
to inhibit them.</p>

<p class='c012'>The kind of man most characteristic of these times,
I take it, does not allow himself to be drawn into
the tangle of merely personal hatred, but, cultivating
a tolerance for all sorts of men, he yet maintains a
sober and determined antagonism toward all tendencies
or purposes that conflict with his true self, with
whatever he has most intimately appropriated and
identified with his character. He is always courteous,
cherishes as much as possible those kindly sentiments
which are not only pleasant and soothing but
do much to oil the machinery of his enterprises, and
by wasting no energy on futile passion is enabled to
think all the more clearly and act the more inflexibly
when he finds antagonism necessary. A man of the
world of the modern type is hardly ever dramatic in
the style of Shakespeare’s heroes. He usually expresses
himself in the most economical manner possible,
and if he has to threaten, for instance, knows
how to do it by a movement of the lips, or the turn
of a phrase in a polite note. If cruder and more
violent tactics are necessary, to impress vulgar minds,
he is very likely to depute this rough work to a subordinate.
A foreman of track hands may have to
be a loud-voiced, strong-armed, palpably aggressive
person; but the president of the road is commonly
quiet and mild-mannered.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mind is greatly aided in the control of animosity
by the existence of ready-made and socially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>accepted standards of right. Suffering from his own
angry passions and from those of others, one looks
out for some criterion, some rule of what is just and
fair among persons, which he may hold himself and
others to, and moderate antagonism by removing
the sense of peculiar injury. Opposition itself, within
certain limits, comes to be regarded as part of the
reasonable order of things. In this view the function
of moral standards is the same as that of courts of
justice in grosser conflicts. All good citizens want the
laws to be definite and vigorously enforced, in order
to avoid the uncertainty, waste, and destruction of a
lawless condition. In the same way right-minded
people want definite moral standards, enforced by
general opinion, in order to save the mental wear and
tear of unguided feeling. It is a great relief to a
person harassed by hostile emotion to find a point of
view from which this emotion appears wrong or irrational,
so that he can proceed definitely and with the
sanction of his reason to put it down. The next best
thing, perhaps, is to have the hostility definitely approved
by reason, so that he may indulge it without
further doubt. The unsettled condition is worst of
all.</p>

<p class='c012'>This control of hostility by a sense of common
allegiance to rule is well illustrated by athletic games.
When properly conducted they proceed upon a definite
understanding of what is fair, and no lasting
anger is felt for any hurts inflicted, so long as this
standard of fairness is maintained. It is the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>in war: soldiers do not necessarily feel any anger at
other soldiers who are trying to shoot them to death.
That is thought of as within the rules of the game.
As Admiral Cervera’s chief of staff is reported to
have said to Admiral Sampson, “You know there is
nothing personal in this.” But if the white flag is
used treacherously, explosive bullets employed, or
the moral standard otherwise transgressed, there is
hard feeling. It is very much the same with the
multiform conflicts of purpose in modern industrial
life. It is not clear that competition as such,
apart from the question of fairness or unfairness, has
any tendency to increase hostility. Competition
and the clash of purposes are inseparable from activity,
and are felt to be so. Ill-feeling flourishes no
more in an active, stirring state of society than in a
stagnant state. The trouble with our industrial relations
is not the mere extent of competition, but
the partial lack of established laws, rules, and customs,
to determine what is right and fair in it.
This partial lack of standards is connected with the
rapid changes in industry and industrial relations
among men, with which the development of law and of
moral criteria has by no means kept pace. Hence there
arises great uncertainty as to what some persons and
classes may rightly and fairly require of other persons
and classes; and this uncertainty lets loose angry
imaginations.</p>

<p class='c012'>It will be evident that I do not look upon affection,
or anger, or any other particular mode of feeling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>as in itself good or bad, social or anti-social, progressive
or retrogressive. It seems to me that the essentially
good, social, or progressive thing, in this regard,
is the organization and discipline of all emotions by
the aid of reason, in harmony with a developing general
life, which is summed up for us in conscience.
That this development of the general life is such as
to tend ultimately to do away with hostile feeling
altogether, is not clear. The actively good people,
the just men, reformers, and prophets, not excepting
him who drove the money-changers from the Temple,
have been and are, for the most part, people who
feel the spur of resentment; and it is not evident
that this can cease to be the case. The diversity of
human minds and endeavors seems to be an essential
part of the general plan of things, and shows no
tendency to diminish. This diversity involves a conflict
of ideas and purposes, which, in those who take
it earnestly, is likely to occasion hostile feeling.
This feeling should become less wayward, violent,
bitter, or personal, in a narrow sense, and more disciplined,
rational, discriminating, and quietly persistent.
That it ought to disappear is certainly not apparent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something similar to what has been said of anger
will hold true of any well-marked type of instinctive
emotion. If we take fear, for instance, and try to
recall our experience of it from early childhood on,
it seems clear that, while the emotion itself may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>change but little, the ideas, occasions, suggestions
that excite it depend upon the state of our intellectual
and social development, and so undergo great alteration.
The feeling does not tend to disappear,
but to become less violent and spasmodic, more and
more social as regards the objects that excite it, and
more and more subject, in the best minds, to the discipline
of reason.</p>

<p class='c012'>The fears of little children<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> are largely excited by
immediate sensible experiences—darkness, solitude,
sharp noises, and so on. Sensitive persons often
remain throughout life subject to irrational fears of
this sort, and it is well known that they play a conspicuous
part in hysteria, insanity, and other weak or
morbid conditions. But for the most part the healthy
adult mind becomes accustomed and indifferent to
these simple phenomena, and transfers its emotional
sensibility to more complex interests. These interests
are for the most part sympathetic, involving our
social rather than our material self—our standing in
the minds of other people, the well-being of those we
care for, and so on. Yet these fears—fear of standing
alone, of losing one’s place in the flow of human
action and sympathy, fear for the character and success
of those near to us—have often the very quality
of childish fear. A man cast out of his regular occupation
and secure place in the system of the world
feels a terror like that of the child in the dark; just as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>impulsive, perhaps just as purposeless and paralyzing.
The main difference seems to be that the latter
fear is stimulated by a complex idea, implying a
socially imaginative habit of mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>Social fear, of a sort perhaps somewhat morbid, is
vividly depicted by Rousseau in the passage of his
Confessions where he describes the feeling that led
him falsely to accuse a maid-servant of a theft which
he had himself committed. “When she appeared my
heart was agonized, but the presence of so many
people was more powerful than my compunction. I
did not fear punishment, but I dreaded shame: I
dreaded it more than death, more than the crime,
more than all the world. I would have buried, hid myself
in the centre of the earth: invincible shame bore
down every other sentiment; shame alone caused all
my impudence, and in proportion as I became criminal
the fear of discovery rendered me intrepid. I
felt no dread but that of being detected, of being
publicly and to my face declared a thief, liar, and
calumniator....”<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>So also we might distinguish, as in the case of
anger, a higher form of social fear, one that is not
narrowly personal, but relates to some socially
derived ideal of good or right. For instance, in a
soldier the terror of roaring guns and singing bullets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>would be a fear of the lowest or animal type. Dread
of the disgrace to follow running away would be a
social fear, yet not of the highest sort, because the
thing dreaded is not wrong but shame—a comparatively
simple and non-rational idea. People often do
what they know is wrong under the influence of such
fear, as did Rousseau in the incident quoted above.
But, supposing the soldier’s highest ideal to be the
success of his army and his country, a fear for that,
overcoming all lower and cruder fears—selfish fears
as they would ordinarily be called—would be moral
or ethical.</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Conformity—Non-conformity—The Two Viewed as Complementary
Phases of Life—Rivalry—Hero-worship.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>It will be convenient to distinguish three sorts of
emulation—conformity, rivalry, and hero-worship.</p>

<p class='c012'>Conformity may be defined as the endeavor to
maintain a standard set by a group. It is a voluntary
imitation of prevalent modes of action, distinguished
from rivalry and other aggressive phases of
emulation by being comparatively passive, aiming to
keep up rather than to excel, and concerning itself
for the most part with what is outward and formal.
On the other hand, it is distinguished from involuntary
imitation by being intentional instead of mechanical.
Thus it is not conformity, for most of us,
to speak the English language, because we have
practically no choice in the matter, but we might
choose to conform to particular pronunciations or
turns of speech used by those with whom we wish
to associate.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ordinary motive to conformity is a sense, more
or less vivid, of the pains and inconveniences of non-conformity.
Most people find it painful to go to an
evening company in any other than the customary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>dress; the source of the pain appearing to be a
vague sense of the depreciatory curiosity which one
imagines that he will excite. His social self-feeling
is hurt by an unfavorable view of himself that he
attributes to others. This example is typical of the
way the group coerces each of its members in all
matters concerning which he has no strong and definite
private purpose. The world constrains us without
any definite intention to do so, merely through
the impulse, common to all, to despise peculiarity for
which no reason is perceived. “Nothing in the world
more subtle,” says George Eliot, speaking of the
decay of higher aims in certain people, “than the
process of their gradual change! In the beginning
they inhaled it unknowingly; you and I may have
sent some of our breath toward infecting them, when
we uttered our conforming falsities or drew our silly
conclusions: or perhaps it came with the vibrations
from a woman’s glance.” “Solitude is fearsome and
heavy-hearted,” and non-conformity condemns us to it
by causing <em>gêne</em>, if not dislike, in others, and so interrupting
that relaxation and spontaneity of attitude
that is required for the easy flow of sympathy and
communication. Thus it is hard to be at ease with
one who is conspicuously worse or better dressed
than we are, or whose manners are notably different;
no matter how little store our philosophy may set by
such things. On the other hand, a likeness in small
things that enables them to be forgotten gives people
a <em>prima facie</em> at-homeness with each other highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>favorable to sympathy; and so we all wish to have it
with people we care for.</p>

<p class='c012'>It would seem that the repression of non-conformity
is a native impulse, and that tolerance always
requires some moral exertion. We all cherish our
habitual system of thought, and anything that breaks
in upon it in a seemingly wanton manner, is annoying
to us and likely to cause resentment. So our first
tendency is to suppress the peculiar, and we learn to
endure it only when we must, either because it is
shown to be reasonable or because it proves refractory
to our opposition. The innovator is nearly as
apt as anyone else to put down innovation in others.
Words denoting singularity usually carry some reproach
with them; and it would perhaps be found
that the more settled the social system is, the severer
is the implied condemnation. In periods of disorganization
and change, such as ours is in many respects,
people are educated to comparative tolerance
by unavoidable familiarity with conflicting
views—as religious toleration, for instance, is the
outcome of the continued spectacle of competing
creeds.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir Henry Maine, in discussing the forces that
controlled the legal decisions of a Roman prætor,
remarks that he “was kept within the narrowest
bounds by the prepossessions imbibed from early
training and by the strong restraints of professional
opinion, restraints of which the stringency can only
be appreciated by those who have personally experienced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>them.”<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a> In the same way every profession,
trade or handicraft, every church, circle, fraternity or
clique, has its more or less definite standards, conformity
to which it tends to impose on all its members.
It is not at all essential that there should be
any deliberate purpose to set up these standards, or
any special machinery for enforcing them. They
spring up spontaneously, as it were, by an unconscious
process of assimilation, and are enforced by
the mere inertia of the minds constituting the group.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus every variant idea of conduct has to fight its
way: as soon as anyone attempts to do anything unexpected
the world begins to cry, “Get in the rut!
Get in the rut! Get in the rut!” and shoves, stares,
coaxes, and sneers until he does so—or until he
makes good his position, and so, by altering the
standard in a measure, establishes a new basis of
conformity. There are no people who are altogether
non-conformers, or who are completely tolerant
of non-conformity in others. Mr. Lowell, who
wrote some of the most stirring lines in literature in
defence of non-conformity, was himself conventional
and an upholder of conventions in letters and social
intercourse. Either to be exceptional or to appreciate
the exceptional requires a considerable expenditure
of energy, and no one can afford this in many
directions. There are many persons who take
pains to keep their minds open; and there are
groups, countries, and periods which are comparatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>favorable to open-mindedness and variation;
but conformity is always the rule and non-conformity
the exception.</p>

<p class='c012'>Conformity is a sort of co-operation: one of its
functions is to economize energy. The standards
which it presses upon the individual are often elaborate
and valuable products of cumulative thought and
experience, and whatever imperfections they may
have they are, as a whole, an indispensable foundation
for life: it is inconceivable that anyone should dispense
with them. If I imitate the dress, the manners,
the household arrangements of other people, I save
so much mental energy for other purposes. It is best
that each should originate where he is specially fitted
to do so, and follow others where they are better
qualified to lead. It is said with truth that conformity
is a drag upon genius; but it is equally true
and important that its general action upon human
nature is elevating. We get by it the selected and
systematized outcome of the past, and to be brought
up to its standards is a brief recapitulation of social
development: it sometimes levels down but more
generally levels up. It may be well for purposes of
incitement to goad our individuality by the abuse of
conformity; but statements made with this in view
lack accuracy. It is good for the young and aspiring
to read Emerson’s praise of self-reliance, in order
that they may have courage to fight for their ideas;
but we may also sympathize with Goethe when he
says that “nothing more exposes us to madness than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>distinguishing us from others, and nothing more contributes
to maintaining our common-sense than living
in the universal way with multitudes of men.”<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>There are two aspects of non-conformity: first, a rebellious
impulse or “contrary suggestion” leading to
an avoidance of accepted standards in a spirit of opposition,
without necessary reference to any other standards;
and, second, an appeal from present and commonplace
standards to those that are comparatively
remote and unusual. These two usually work together.
One is led to a mode of life different from
that of the people about him, partly by intrinsic contrariness,
and partly by fixing his imagination on the
ideas and practices of other people whose mode of
life he finds more congenial.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the essence of non-conformity as a personal
attitude consists in contrary suggestion or the spirit
of opposition. People of natural energy take pleasure
in that enhanced feeling of self that comes from
consciously <em>not</em> doing that which is suggested or enjoined
upon them by circumstances and by other
persons. There is joy in the sense of self-assertion:
it is sweet to do one’s own things; and if others are
against him one feels sure they <em>are</em> his own. To brave
the disapproval of men is tonic; it is like climbing
along a mountain path in the teeth of the wind; one
feels himself as a cause, and knows the distinctive
efficacy of his being. Thus self-feeling which, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>somewhat languid and on the defensive, causes us to
avoid peculiarity, may, when in a more energetic condition,
cause us to seek it; just as we rejoice at one
time to brave the cold, and at another to cower over
the fire, according to the vigor of our circulation.</p>

<p class='c012'>This may easily be observed in vigorous children:
each in his way will be found to attach himself to
methods of doing things which he regards as peculiarly
his own, and to delight in asserting these methods
against opposition. It is also the basis of some of
the deepest and most significant differences between
races and individuals. Controlled by intellect and
purpose this passion for differentiation becomes self-reliance,
self-discipline, and immutable persistence in
a private aim: qualities which more than any others
make the greater power of superior persons and races.
It is a source of enterprise, exploration, and endurance
in all kinds of undertakings, and of fierce defence
of private rights. How much of Anglo-Saxon
history is rooted in the intrinsic cantankerousness of
the race! It is largely this that makes the world-winning
pioneer, who keeps pushing on because he
wants a place all to himself, and hates to be bothered
by other people over whom he has no control. On
the frontier a common man defines himself better as
a cause. He looks round at his clearing, his cabin, his
growing crops, his wife, his children, his dogs, horses,
and cattle, and says, <em>I did it: they are mine</em>. All that
he sees recalls the glorious sense of things won by his
own hand.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Who does not feel that it is a noble thing to stand
alone, to steer due west into an unknown universe,
like Columbus, or, like Nansen, ground the ship upon
the ice-pack and drift for the North Pole? “Adhere
to your own act,” says Emerson, “and congratulate
yourself if you have done something strange and
extravagant, and broken the monotony of a decorous
age.” We like that epigram, <em>Victrix causa diis
placuit, sed victa Catoni</em>, because we like the thought
that a man stood out alone against the gods themselves,
and set his back against the course of nature.

</div>

<p class='c017'>are not to be thought of as victims of self-sacrifice.
Many of them rejoiced in just that isolation, and daring,
and persistence; so that it was not self-sacrifice
but self-realization. Conflict is a necessity of the
active soul, and if a social order could be created
from which it were absent, that order would perish
as uncongenial to human nature. “To be a man is
to be a non-conformer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I think that people go into all sorts of enterprises,
for instance into novel and unaccredited sorts of
philanthropy, with a spirit of adventure not far removed
from the spirit that seeks the North Pole. It
is neither true nor wholesome to think of the “good”
as actuated by motives radically different in kind
from those of ordinary human nature; and I imagine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the best of them are far from wishing to be thus
thought of. Undertakings of reform and philanthropy
appeal to the mind in a double aspect. There is, of
course, the desire to accomplish some worthy end, to
effectuate some cherished sentiment which the world
appears to ignore, to benefit the oppressed, to advance
human knowledge, or the like. But behind that is
the vague need of self-expression, of creation, of a
momentous experience, so that one may know that
one has really lived. And the finer imaginations are
likely to find this career of novelty and daring, not in
the somewhat outworn paths of war and exploration,
but in new and precarious kinds of social activity.
So one may sometimes meet in social settlements and
charity organization bureaus the very sort of people
that led the Crusades into Palestine. I do not speak
at random, but have several persons in mind who
seem to me to be of this sort.</p>

<p class='c012'>In its second aspect non-conformity may be regarded
as a remoter conformity. The rebellion
against social influence is only partial and apparent;
and the one who seems to be out of step with the
procession is really keeping time to another music.
As Thoreau said, he hears a different drummer. If a
boy refuses the occupation his parents and friends
think best for him, and persists in working at something
strange and fantastic, like art or science, it is
sure to be the case that his most vivid life is not with
those about him at all, but with the masters he has
known through books, or perhaps seen and heard for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>a few moments. Environment, in the sense of social
influence actually at work, is far from the definite
and obvious thing it is often assumed to be. Our
real environment consists of those images which are
most present to our thoughts, and in the case of a
vigorous, growing mind, these are likely to be something
quite different from what is most present to the
senses. The group to which we give allegiance, and
to whose standards we try to conform, is determined
by our own selective affinity, choosing among all
the personal influences accessible to us; and so far
as we select with any independence of our palpable
companions, we have the appearance of non-conformity.</p>

<p class='c012'>All non-conformity that is affirmative or constructive
must act by this selection of remoter relations;
opposition, by itself, being sterile, and meaning
nothing beyond personal peculiarity. There is,
therefore, no definite line between conformity and non-conformity;
there is simply a more or less characteristic
and unusual way of selecting and combining
accessible influences. It is much the same question
as that of invention <em>versus</em> imitation. As Professor
Baldwin points out, there is no radical separation
between these two aspects of human thought and
action. There is no imitation that is absolutely
mechanical and uninventive—a man cannot repeat an
act without putting something of his idiosyncrasy
into it—neither is there any invention that is not
imitative in the sense that it is made up of elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>suggested by observation and experience. What the
mind does, in any case, is to reorganize and reproduce
the suggested materials in accordance with its
own structure and tendency; and we judge the result
as imitative or inventive, original or commonplace,
according as it does or does not strike us as a new
and fruitful employment of the common material.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A just view of the matter should embrace the
whole of it at once, and see conformity and non-conformity
as normal and complementary phases of
human activity. In their quieter moods men have a
pleasure in social agreement and the easy flow of
sympathy, which makes non-conformity uncomfortable.
But when their energy is full and demanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>an outlet through the instincts, it can only be appeased
by something which gives the feeling of self-assertion.
They are agitated by a “creative impatience,”
an outburst of the primal need to act; like
the Norsemen, of whom Gibbon says: “Impatient
of a bleak climate and narrow limits, they started
from the banquet, sounded their horn, ascended their
vessels, and explored every coast that promised either
spoil or settlement.”<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a> In social intercourse this active
spirit finds its expression largely in resisting the
will of others; and the spirit of opposition and self-differentiation
thus arising is the principal direct
stimulus to non-conformity. This spirit, however,
has no power of absolute creation, and is forced to
seek for suggestions and materials in the minds of
others; so that the independence is only relative to
the more immediate and obvious environment, and
never constitutes a real revolt from the social
order.</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally non-conformity is characteristic of the
more energetic states of the human mind. Men of
great vigor are sure to be non-conformers in some
important respect; youth glories in non-conformity,
while age usually comes back to the general point of
view. “Men are conservatives when they are least
vigorous, or when they are most luxurious. They
are conservatives after dinner, or before taking their
rest; when they are sick or aged. In the morning,
or when their intellect or their conscience has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>aroused, when they hear music, or when they read
poetry, they are radicals.”<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c013'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The rational attitude of the individual toward the
question of conformity or non-conformity in his own
life, would seem to be: assert your individuality in
matters which you deem important; conform in those
you deem unimportant. To have a conspicuously individual
way of doing everything is impossible to a
sane person, and to attempt it would be to do one’s
self a gratuitous injury, by closing the channels of
sympathy through which we partake of the life around
us. We should save our strength for matters in regard
to which persistent conviction impels us to insist
upon our own way.</p>

<p class='c012'>Society, like every living, advancing whole, requires
a just union of stability and change, uniformity and
differentiation. Conformity is the phase of stability
and uniformity, while non-conformity is the phase of
differentiation and change. The latter cannot introduce
anything wholly new, but it can and does effect
such a reorganization of existing material as constantly
to transform and renew human life.</p>

<p class='c011'>I mean by rivalry a competitive striving urged on
by the desire to win. It resembles conformity in
that the impelling idea is usually a sense of what
other people are doing and thinking, and especially
of what they are thinking of us: it differs from it
chiefly in being more aggressive. Conformity aims
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>to keep up with the procession, rivalry to get ahead
of it. The former is moved by a sense of the pains
and inconveniences of differing from other people,
the latter by an eagerness to compel their admiration.
Winning, to the social self, usually means
conspicuous success in making some desired impression
upon other minds, as in becoming distinguished
for power, wealth, skill, culture, beneficence, or the
like.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, rivalry may be distinguished
from finer sorts of emulation by being more simple,
crude, and direct. It implies no very subtle mental
activity, no elaborate or refined ideal. If a spirited
horse hears another overtaking him from behind, he
pricks up his ears, quickens his steps, and does his
best to keep ahead. And human rivalry appears to
have much of this instinctive element in it; to become
aware of life and striving going on about us
seems to act immediately upon the nerves, quickening
an impulse to live and strive in like manner. An
eager person will not hear or read of vivid action of
any sort without feeling some impulse to get into it;
just as he cannot mingle in a hurrying, excited crowd
without sharing in the excitement and hurry, whether
he knows what it is all about or not. The genesis
of ambition is often something as follows: one mingles
with men, his self-feeling is vaguely aroused,
and he wishes to be something to them. He sees,
perhaps, that he cannot excel in just what they are
doing, and so he takes refuge in his imagination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>thinking what he <em>can</em> do which is admirable, and determining
to do it. Thus he goes home nursing secret
ambitions.</p>

<p class='c012'>The motive of rivalry, then, is a strong sense
that there is a race going on, and an impulsive
eagerness to be in it. It is rather imitative than inventive;
the idea being not so much to achieve an
object for its own sake, because it is reflectively
judged to be worthy, as to get what the rest are after.
There is conformity in ideals combined with a
thirst for personal distinction. It has little tendency
toward innovation, notwithstanding the element of
antagonism in it; but takes its color and character
from the prevalent social life, accepting and pursuing
the existing ideal of success, and whatever special
quality it has depends upon the quality of that ideal.
There is, for instance, nothing so gross or painful
that it may not become an object of pursuit through
emulation. Charles Booth, who has studied so minutely
the slums of London, says that “among the
poor, men drink on and on from a perverted pride,”
and among another class a similar sentiment leads
women to inflict surprising deformities of the trunk
upon themselves.</p>

<p class='c012'>Professor William James suggests that rivalry
does nine-tenths of the world’s work.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a> Certainly no
motive is so generally powerful among active, efficient
men of the ordinary type, the type that keeps the
ball moving all over the world. Intellectual initiative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>high and persistent idealism, are rare. The
great majority of able men are ambitious, without
having intrinsic traits that definitely direct their ambition
to any particular object. They feel their way
about among the careers which their time, their
country, their early surroundings and training, make
accessible to them, and, selecting the one which
seems to promise the best chance of success, they
throw themselves into the pursuit of the things that
conduce to that success. If the career is law, they
strive to win cases and gain wealth and prestige,
accepting the moral code and other standards that
they find in actual use; and it is the same, <em>mutatis
mutandis</em>, in commerce, politics, the ministry, the
various handicrafts, and so on.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is thus nothing morally distinctive about
rivalry; it is harmful or beneficent according to the
objects and standards with reference to which it acts.
All depends upon the particular game in which one
takes a hand. It may be said in a broad way, however,
that rivalry supplies a stimulus wholesome and
needful to the great majority of men, and that it is,
on the whole, a chief progressive force, utilizing the
tremendous power of ambition, and controlling it to
the furtherance of ends that are socially approved.
The great mass of what we judge to be evil is of a
negative rather than a positive character, arising not
from misdirected ambition but from apathy or sensuality,
from a falling short of that active, social humanity
which ambition implies.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>By hero-worship is here meant an emulation that
strives to imitate some admired character, in a spirit
not of rivalry or opposition, but of loyal enthusiasm.
It is higher than rivalry, in the sense that it involves
a superior grade of mental activity—though, of course,
there is no sharp line of separation between them.
While the other is a rather gross and simple impulse,
common to all men and to the higher animals, the
hero-worshipper is an idealist, imaginative; the object
that arouses his enthusiasm and his endeavor
does so because it bears a certain relation to his aspirations,
to his constructive thought. Hero-worship
is thus more selective, more significant of the special
character and tendencies of the individual, in every
way more highly organized than rivalry.</p>

<p class='c012'>It has a great place in all active, aspiring lives,
especially in the plastic period of youth. We feed
our characters, while they are forming, upon the
vision of admired models; an ardent sympathy dwells
upon the traits through which their personality is
communicated to us—facial expression, voice, significant
movements, and so on. In this way those
tendencies in us that are toward them are literally
fed; are stimulated, organized, made habitual and
familiar. As already pointed out, sympathy appears
to be an act of growth; and this is especially true of
the sort of sympathy we call hero-worship. All autobiographies
which deal with youth show that the
early development of character is through a series of
admirations and enthusiasms, which pass away, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>sure, but leave character the richer for their existence.
They begin in the nursery, flourish with great
vigor in the school-yard, attain a passionate intensity
during adolescence, and though they abate rapidly in
adult life, do not altogether cease until the power of
growth is lost. All will find, I imagine, if they recall
their own experience, that times of mental progress
were times when the mind found or created heroes to
worship, often owning allegiance to several at the
same time, each representing a particular need of
development. The active tendencies of the schoolboy
lead to admiration of the strongest and boldest
of his companions; or perhaps, more imaginative, he
fixes his thoughts on some famous fighter or explorer;
later it is possibly a hero of statesmanship or literature
who attracts him. Whatever the tendency, it
is sure to have its complementary hero. Even science
often begins in hero-worship. “This work,” says
Darwin of Humboldt’s “Personal Narrative,” “stirred
up in me a burning zeal to add even the most
humble contribution to the noble structure of Natural
Science.”<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c013'><sup>[80]</sup></a> We easily forget this varied and impassioned
idealism of early life; but “the thoughts
of youth are long, long thoughts,” and it is precisely
then and in this way that the most rapid development
of character takes place. J. A. Symonds, speaking
of Professor Jowett’s early influence upon him
says, “Obscurely but vividly I felt my soul grow by
his contact, as it had never grown before;” and Goethe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>remarks that “vicinity to the master, like an element,
lifts one and bears him on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If youth is the period of hero-worship, so also is it
true that hero-worship, more than anything else, perhaps,
gives one the sense of youth. To admire, to
expand one’s self, to forget the rut, to have a sense of
newness and life and hope, is to feel young at any
time of life. “Whilst we converse with what is
above us we do not grow old but grow young”; and
that is what hero-worship means. To have no heroes
is to have no aspiration, to live on the momentum of
the past, to be thrown back upon routine, sensuality,
and the narrow self.</p>

<p class='c012'>As hero-worship becomes more imaginative, it
merges insensibly into that devotion to ideal persons
that is called religious. It has often been pointed
out that the feeling men have toward a visible leader
and master like Lincoln, Lee, Napoleon, or Garibaldi,
is psychologically much the same thing as the worship
of the ideal persons of religion. Hero-worship
is a kind of religion, and religion, in so far as it conceives
persons, is a kind of hero-worship. Both are
expressions of that intrinsically social or communicative
nature of human thought and sentiment which
was insisted upon in a previous chapter. That the
personality toward which the feeling is directed is
ideal evidently affords no fundamental distinction.
All persons are ideal, in a true sense, and those
whom we admire and reverence are peculiarly so.
That is to say, the idea of a person, whether his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>body be present to our senses or not, is imaginative,
a synthesis, an interpretation of many elements, resting
upon our whole experience of human life, not
merely upon our acquaintance with this particular
person; and the more our admiration and reverence
are awakened the more actively ideal and imaginative
does our conception of the person become. Of
course we never <em>see</em> a person; we see a few visible
traits which stimulate our imaginations to the construction
of a personal idea in the mind. The ideal
persons of religion are not fundamentally different,
psychologically or sociologically, from other persons;
they are personal ideas built up in the mind out of
the material at its disposal, and serving to appease
its need for a sort of intercourse that will give scope
to reverence, submission, trust, and self-expanding enthusiasm.
So far as they are present to thought and
emotion, and so work upon life, they are real, with
that immediate social reality discussed in the third
chapter. The fact that they have attached to them
no visible or tangible material body, similar to that
of other persons, is indeed an important fact, but
rather of physiological than of psychological or social
interest. Perhaps it is not going too far to say
that the idea of God is <em>specially</em> mysterious only from
a physiological point of view; mentally and socially
regarded it is of one sort with other personal ideas,
no less a verifiable fact, and no more or less inscrutable.
It must be obvious to anyone who reflects
upon the matter, I should think, that our conceptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>of personality, from the simple and sensuous notions
a little child has of those about him, up to the
noblest and fullest idea of deity that man can achieve,
are one in kind, as being imaginative interpretations
of experience, and form a series in which there are
no breaks, no gap between human and divine. All
is human, and all, if you please, divine.</p>

<p class='c012'>If there are any who hold that nothing is real except
what can be seen and touched, they will necessarily
forego the study of persons and of society;
because these things are essentially intangible and
invisible. The bodily presence furnishes important
assistance in the forming of personal ideas, but is
not essential. I never saw Shakespeare, and have
no lively notion of how he looked. His reality, his
presence to my mind, consists in a characteristic impression
made upon me by his recorded words, an
imaginative interpretation or inference from a book.
In a manner equally natural and simple the religious
mind comes to the idea of personal deity by a spontaneous
interpretation of life as a whole. The two
ideas are equally real, equally incapable of verification
<em>to the senses</em>.</p>

and Hope—Mystery—Good Faith and Imposture—Does
the Leader Really Lead?</span></p>

<p class='c011'>But how do we choose our heroes? What is it that
gives leadership to some and denies it to others? Can
we make out anything like a <em>rationale</em> of personal
ascendency? We can hardly hope for a complete
answer to these questions, which probe the very heart
of life and tendency, but at least the attempt to answer
them, so far as possible, will bring us into an
interesting line of thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is plain that the theory of ascendency involves
the question of the mind’s relative valuation
of the suggestions coming to it from other minds;
leadership depending upon the efficacy of a personal
impression to awaken feeling, thought, action, and so
to become a cause of life. While there are some
men who seem but to add one to the population,
there are others whom we cannot help thinking
about; they lend arguments to their neighbors’
creeds, so that the life of their contemporaries, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>perhaps of following generations, is notably different
because they have lived. The immediate reason for
this difference is evidently that in the one case there
is something seminal or generative in the relation
between the personal impression a man makes and
the mind that receives it, which is lacking in the other
case. If we could go farther than this and discover
what it is that makes certain suggestions seminal or
generative, we should throw much light on leadership,
and through that on all questions of social
tendency.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are born with what may be roughly described
as a vaguely differentiated mass of mental tendency,
vast and potent, but unformed and needing direction—<em>informe,
ingens, cui lumen ademptum</em>. This instinctive
material is believed to be the outcome of age-long
social development in the race, and hence to be, in a
general way, expressive of that development and functional
in its continuance. The process of evolution
has established a probability that a man will find
himself at home in the world into which he comes,
and prepared to share in its activities. Besides the
tendency to various sorts of emotion, we have the
thinking instinct, the intelligence, which seems to be
fairly distinct from emotion and whose function includes
the co-ordination and organization of other
instinctive material with reference to the situations
which life offers.</p>

<p class='c012'>At any particular stage of individual existence,
these elements, together with the suggestions from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the world without, are found more or less perfectly
organized into a living, growing whole, a
person, a man. Obscurely locked within him, inscrutable
to himself as to others, is the soul of the
whole past, his portion of the energy, the passion,
the tendency, of human life. Its existence creates a
vague need to live, to feel, to act; but he cannot fulfil
this need, at least not in a normal way, without
incitement from outside to loosen and direct his instinctive
aptitude. There is explosive material stored
up in him, but it cannot go off unless the right spark
reaches it, and that spark is usually some sort of a
personal suggestion, some living trait that sets life
free and turns restlessness into power.</p>

<p class='c012'>It must be evident that we can look for no cut-and-dried
theory of this life-imparting force, no algebraic
formula for leadership. We know but little of the
depths of human tendency; and those who know
most are possibly the poets, whose knowledge is little
available for precise uses. Moreover, the problem
varies incalculably with sex, age, race, inherited idiosyncrasy,
and previous personal development. The
general notions of evolution, however, lead us to
expect that what awakens life and so gives ascendency
will be something important or functional in the past
life of the race, something appealing to instincts which
have survived because they had a part to perform;
and this, generally speaking, appears to be the case.</p>

<p class='c011'>The prime condition of ascendency is the presence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of undirected energy in the person over whom it is to
be exercised; it is not so much forced upon us from
without as demanded from within. The mind, having
energy, must work, and requires a guide, a form
of thought, to facilitate its working. All views of
life are fallacious which do not recognize the fact
that the primary need is the need to do. Every
healthy organism evolves energy, and this must have
an outlet. In the human mind, during its expanding
period, the excess of life takes the form of a reaching
out beyond all present and familiar things after an
unknown good; no matter what the present and
familiar may be, the fact that it is such is enough to
make it inadequate. So we have a vague onward
impulse, which is the unorganized material, the undifferentiated
protoplasm, so to speak, of all progress;
and this, as we have seen, makes the eagerness
of hero-worship in the young, imaginative and
aspiring. So long as our minds and hearts are open
and capable of progress, there are persons that have
a glamour for us, of whom we think with reverence
and aspiration; and although the glamour may pass
from them and leave them commonplace, it will have
fixed itself somewhere else. In youth the mind,
eager, searching, forward looking, stands at what
Professor Baldwin calls the alter pole of the socius,
peering forth in search of new life. And the idealist
at any age needs superiority in others and is always
in quest of it. “Dear to us are those who love us,&#160;... but dearer are those who reject us as unworthy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>for they add another life; they build a
heaven before us whereof we had not dreamed, and
thereby supply to us new powers out of the recesses
of the spirit, and urge us to new and unattempted
performances.”<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c013'><sup>[81]</sup></a> To cease to admire is a proof of
deterioration.</p>

<p class='c012'>Most people will be able to recall vague yet intensely
vivid personal impressions that they have
received from faces—perhaps from a single glance
of a countenance that they have never seen before
or since—or perhaps from a voice; and these impressions
often remain and grow and become an
important factor in life. The explanation is perhaps
something like this: When we receive these mysterious
influences we are usually in a peculiarly impressionable
state, with nervous energy itching to be
worked off. There is pressure in the obscure reservoirs
of hereditary passion. In some way, which we
can hardly expect to define, this energy is tapped, an
instinct is disengaged, the personal suggestion conveyed
in the glance is felt as the symbol, the master-key
that can unlock hidden tendency. It is much
the same as when electricity stored and inert in a jar is
loosed by a chance contact of wires that completes
the circuit; the mind holds fast the life-imparting
suggestion; cannot, in fact, let go of it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>It is true of races, as of individuals, that the more
vitality and onwardness they have, the more they
need ideals and a leadership that gives form to them.
A strenuous people like the Anglo-Saxon must have
something to look forward and up to, since without
faith of some sort they must fall into dissipation or
despair; they can never be content with that calm
and symmetrical enjoyment of the present which is
thought to have been characteristic of the ancient
Greeks. To be sure it is said, and no doubt with
truth, that the people of Northern Europe are less
hero-worshippers than those of the South, in the
sense that they are less given to blind enthusiasm for
popular idols; but this, I take it, only means that
the former, having more constructive power in building
up ideals from various personal sources, and more
persistence in adhering to them when thus built up,
are more sober and independent in their judgment of
particular persons, and less liable to extravagant admiration
of the hero of the moment. But their idealism
is all the more potent for this, and at bottom is
just as dependent upon personal suggestion for its
definition. Thus it is likely that all leadership will
be found to be such by virtue of defining the possibilities
of the mind. “If we survey the field of
history,” says Professor William James, “and ask
what feature all great periods of revival, of expansion
of the human mind, display in common, we shall
find, I think, simply this; that each and all of them
have said to the human being, ‘the inmost nature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the reality is congenial to <em>powers</em> which you possess’”;<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c013'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
and the same principle evidently applies
to personal leadership.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are born to action; and whatever is capable of
suggesting and guiding action has power over us from
the first. The attention of the new-born child is
fixed by whatever exercises the senses, through motion,
noise, touch, or color. Persons and animals interest
him primarily because they offer a greater amount
and variety of sensible stimulus than other objects.
They move, talk, laugh, coax, fondle, bring food and
so on. The prestige they thus acquire over the
child’s mind is shared with such other stimulating
phenomena as cars, engines, windmills, patches of
sunlight and bright-colored garments. A little later,
when he begins to acquire some control over his
activities, he welcomes eagerly whatever can participate
in and so stimulate and guide them. The
playthings he cares for are those that go, or that he
can do something with—carts, fire-engines, blocks,
and the like. Persons, especially those that share his
interests, maintain and increase their ascendency, and
other children, preferably a little older and of more
varied resources than himself, are particularly welcome.
Among grown-ups he admires most those who
do something that he can understand, whom he can
appreciate as actors and producers—such as the carpenter,
the gardener, the maid in the kitchen. R.
invented the happy word “thinger” to describe this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>sort of people, and while performing similar feats
would proudly proclaim himself a thinger.</p>

<p class='c012'>It will be observed that at this stage a child has
learned to reflect upon action and to discriminate
that which is purposeful and effective from mere
motion; he has gained the notion of power. Himself
constantly trying to do things, he learns to admire
those who can do things better than himself, or who
can suggest new things to do. His father sitting at
his desk probably seems an inert and unattractive
phenomenon, but the man who can make shavings or
dig a deep hole is a hero; and the seemingly perverse
admiration which children at a later age show
for circus men and for the pirates and desperadoes
they read about, is to be explained in a similar manner.
What they want is <em>evident</em> power. The scholar
may possibly be as worthy of admiration as the acrobat
or the policeman; but the boy of ten will seldom
see the matter in that light.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the idea of power and the types of personality
which, as standing for that idea, have ascendency over
us, are a function of our own changing character.
At one stage of their growth nearly all imaginative
boys look upon some famous soldier as the ideal man.
He holds this place as symbol and focus for the
aggressive, contending, dominating impulses of vigorous
boyhood; to admire and sympathize with him is
to gratify, imaginatively, these impulses. In this
country some notable speaker and party leader often
succeeds the soldier as a boyish ideal; his career is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>almost equally dominating and splendid, and, in time
of peace, not quite so remote from reasonable aspiration.
In later life these simple ideals are likely to
yield somewhat to others of a more special character,
depending upon the particular pursuit into which
one’s energies are directed. Every occupation which
is followed with enthusiasm has its heroes, men who
stand for the idea of power or efficient action as
understood by persons of a particular training and
habit. The world of commerce and industry is
full of hero-worship, and men who have made great
fortunes are admired, not unjustly, for the personal
prowess such success implies; while people of a
finer intellectual development have their notion of
power correspondingly refined, and to them the
artist, the poet, the man of science, the philanthropist,
may stand for the highest sort of successful action.</p>

<p class='c012'>It should be observed, however, that the simpler
and more dramatic or visually imaginable kinds of
power have a permanent advantage as regards general
ascendency. Only a few can appreciate the power of
Darwin, and those few only when the higher faculties
of their minds are fully awake; there is nothing
dramatic, nothing appealing to the visual imagination,
in his secluded career. But we can all <em>see</em> Grant
or Nelson or Moltke at the head-quarters of their
armies, or on the decks of their ships, and hear the
roar of their cannons. They hold one by the eye
and by the swelling of an emotion felt to be common
to a vast multitude of people. There is always something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>of the intoxication of the crowd in the submission
to this sort of ascendency. However alone our
bodies may be, our imaginations are in the throng;
and for my part whenever I think of any occasion when
a man played a great part before the eyes of mankind,
I feel a thrill of irrational enthusiasm. I should
imagine, for instance, that scarcely anyone could read
such a thing as “Sheridan’s Ride” without strong
feeling. He witnesses the disorder, uncertainty, and
dismay of the losing battle, the anxious officers trying
to stay the retreat, and longing for the commander
who has always led to victory. Then he follows the
ride from “Winchester twenty miles away,” and
shares the enthusiasm of the army when the valiant
and beloved leader rides forth upon the field at last,
renewing every heart by his presence and making
victory out of defeat. In comparison with this other
kinds of power seem obscure and separate. It is the
drama of visible courage, danger, and success, and
the sense of being one of a throng to behold it, that
makes the difference.</p>

<p class='c012'>This need of a dramatic or visually imaginable
presentation of power is no doubt more imperative in
the childlike peoples of Southern Europe than it is
in the sedater and more abstractly imaginative Teutons;
but it is strong in every people, and is shared
by the most intellectual classes in their emotional
moods. Consequently these heroes of the popular
imagination, especially those of war, are enabled to
serve as the instigators of a common emotion in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>great masses of people, and thus to produce in large
groups a sense of comradeship and solidarity. The
admiration and worship of such heroes is probably
the chief feeling that people have in common in all
early stages of civilization, and the main bond of
social groups. Even in our own time this is more
the case than is understood. It was easy to see, during
the Spanish-American War, that the eager interest
of the whole American people in the military operations,
and the general and enthusiastic admiration of
every trait of heroism, was bringing about a fresh
sense of community throughout the country and so
renewing and consolidating the collective life of the
nation.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we ask what are the mental traits that distinguish
a leader, the only answer seems to be that he must, in
one way or another, be a great deal of a man, or at
least appear to be. He must stand for something to
which men incline, and so take his place by right as
a focus of their thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>Evidently he must be the best of his kind available.
It is impossible that he should stand forth as
an archetype, unless he is conceived as superior, in
some respect, to all others within range of the imagination.
Nothing that is seen to be second-rate can be
an ideal; if a character does not bound the horizon
at some point we will look over it to what we can see
beyond. The object of admiration may be Cæsar
Borgia, or Napoleon, or Jesse James the train-robber,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>but he must be typical, must stand for something.
No matter how bad the leader may be, he will always
be found to owe his leadership to something strong,
affirmative, and superior, something that appeals to
onward instinct.</p>

<p class='c012'>To be a great deal of a man, and hence a leader,
involves, on the one hand, a significant individuality,
and, on the other, breadth of sympathy, the two being
different phases of personal calibre, rather than separate
traits.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is because a man cannot stand for anything except
as he has a significant individuality, that self-reliance
is so essential a trait in leadership: except as
a person trusts and cherishes his own special tendency,
different from that of other people and usually
opposed by them in its inception, he can never develop
anything of peculiar value. He has to free
himself from the domination of purposes already defined
and urged upon him by others, and bring up
something fresh out of the vague under-world of
subconsciousness; and this means an intense self, a
militant, gloating “I.” Emerson’s essay on self-reliance
only formulates what has always been the
creed of significant persons.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, success in unfolding a special
tendency and giving vogue to it, depends upon being
in touch, through sympathy, with the current of
human life. All leadership takes place through the
communication of ideas to the minds of others, and
unless the ideas are so presented as to be congenial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>to those other minds, they will evidently be rejected.
It is because the novelty is not alien to us, but is
seen to be ourself in a fresh guise, that we welcome
it.</p>

<p class='c012'>It has frequently been noticed that personal ascendency
is not necessarily dependent upon any palpable
deed in which power is manifested, but that there is
often a conviction of power and an expectation of
success that go before the deed and control the minds
of men without apparent reason. There is something
fascinating about this immediate and seemingly
causeless personal efficacy, and many writers of insight
lay great stress upon it. Emerson, for example,
is fond of pointing out that the highest sort of
greatness is self-evident, without particular works.
Most men of executive force possess something of
this direct ascendency, and some, like Napoleon,
Cromwell, Bismarck, and Andrew Jackson, have had
it in pre-eminent measure. It is not confined to any
class, however, but exists in an infinite variety of
kinds and degrees; and men of thought may have it
as well as men of action. Dante, Milton, Goethe, and
their like, bear the authority to dominate the minds
of others like a visible mantle upon their shoulders,
inspiring a sense of reverence and a tendency to
believe and follow in all the impressionable people
they meet. Such men are only striking examples of
what we are all familiar with in daily life, most persons
of decided character having something imposing
about them at times. Indeed, there is hardly anyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>so insignificant that he does not seem imposing
to someone at some time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Notwithstanding the mystery that is often made of
this, it appears to be simply a matter of impulsive
personal judgment, an impression of power and a
sense of yielding due to interpretation of the visible
or audible symbols of personality, discussed in a
previous chapter. Another may impress us with
his power, and so exercise ascendency over us, either
by grossly performing the act, or by exhibiting
traits of personality which convince our imaginations
that he can and will do the act if he wishes to. It
is in this latter way, through imaginative inference,
that people mostly work upon us in ordinary social
intercourse. It would puzzle us, in many cases, to
tell just how we know that a man is determined,
dauntless, magnanimous, intrinsically powerful, or
the reverse. Of course reputation and past record
count for much; but we judge readily enough without
them, and if, like Orlando in “As You Like It,”
he “looks successfully,” we believe in him. The imagination
is a sort of clearing-house through which
great forces operate by convenient symbols and with
a minimum of trouble.</p>

<p class='c012'>The man of action who, like Napoleon, can dominate
the minds of others in a crisis, must have the
general traits of leadership developed with special
reference to the promptness of their action. His individual
significance must take the form of a palpable
decision and self-confidence; and breadth of sympathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>becomes a quick tact to grasp the mental state
of those with whom he deals, so that he may know
how to plant the dominating suggestion. Into the
vagueness and confusion that most of us feel in the
face of a strange situation, such a man injects a clearcut
idea. There is a definiteness about him which
makes us feel that he will not leave us drifting, but
will set a course, will substitute action for doubt, and
give our energies an outlet. Again, his aggressive
confidence is transmitted by suggestion, and acts
directly upon our minds as a sanction of his leadership.
And if he adds to this the tact to awaken no
opposition, to make us feel that he is of our sort, that
his suggestions are quite in our line, in a word that
we are safe in his hands; he can hardly be resisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>In face-to-face relations, then, the natural leader is
one who always has the appearance of being master
of the situation. He includes other people and extends
beyond them, and so is in a position to point
out what they must do next. Intellectually his suggestion
seems to embrace what is best in the views of
others, and to embody the inevitable conclusion; it
is the timely, the fit, and so the prevalent. Emotionally
his belief is the strongest force present, and so
draws other beliefs into it. Yet, while he imposes
himself upon others, he feels the other selves as part
of the situation, and so adapts himself to them that
no opposition is awakened; or possibly he may take
the violent method, and browbeat and humiliate a
weak mind: there are various ways of establishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>superiority, but in one way or another the consummate
leader always accomplishes it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Take Bismarck as an example of almost irresistible
personal ascendency in face-to-face relations. He
had the advantage, which, however, many men of
equal power have done without, of an imposing bulk
and stature; but much more than this were the mental
and moral traits which made him appear the natural
master in an assembly of the chief diplomats of Europe.
“No idea can be formed,” says M. de Blowitz,<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c013'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
“of the ascendency exercised by the German Chancellor
over the eminent diplomatists attending the
Congress. Prince Gortchakoff alone, eclipsed by his
rival’s greatness, tried to struggle against him.” His
“great and scornful pride,” the absolute, contemptuous
assurance of superiority which was evident in
every pose, tone, and gesture, accompanied, as is possible
only to one perfectly sure of himself, by a
frankness, good-humor, and cordial insight into others
which seemed to make them one with himself, participators
in his domination; together with a penetrating
intelligence, a unique and striking way of
expressing himself, and a perfect clearness of purpose
at all times, were among the elements of the
effect he produced. He conciliated those whom he
thought it worth while to conciliate, and browbeat,
ignored, or ridiculed the rest. There was nothing a
rival could say or do but Bismarck, if he chose, would
say or do something which made it appear a failure.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>General Grant was a man whose personal presence
had none of the splendor of Prince Bismarck, and
who even appeared insignificant to the undiscerning.
It is related that when he went to take command of
his first regiment soon after the outbreak of the Civil
War, the officer whom he was to succeed paid no attention
to him at first, and would not believe that he
was Grant until he showed his papers. An early
acquaintance said of him, “He hadn’t the push of a
business man.” “He was always a gentleman, and
everybody loved him, for he was so gentle and considerate;
but we didn’t see what he could do in the
world.”<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c013'><sup>[84]</sup></a> Yet over the finer sort of men he exercised
a great ascendency, and no commander was more willingly
obeyed by his subordinates, or inspired more
general confidence. In his way he manifested the
essential traits of decision, self-confidence, and tact
in great measure. He never appeared dubious, nervous,
or unsettled; and though he often talked over
his plans with trusted officers, he only once, I believe,
summoned a council of war, and then rejected
its decision. He was nearly or quite alone in his
faith in the plan by which Vicksburg was taken, and
it is well known that General Sherman, convinced
that it would fail, addressed him a formal remonstrance,
which Grant quietly put in his pocket and
later returned to its author. “His pride in his own
mature opinion,” says General Schofield, “was very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>great; in that he was as far as possible from being a
modest man. This absolute confidence in his own
judgment upon any subject he had mastered, and the
moral courage to take upon himself alone the highest
responsibility, and to demand full authority and freedom
to act according to his own judgment, without
interference from anybody, added to his accurate
estimate of his own ability, and his clear perception
of the necessity for undivided authority and responsibility
in the conduct of military operations, and in
all that concerns the efficiency of armies in time of
war, constituted the foundation of that very great
character.”<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c013'><sup>[85]</sup></a> He was also a man of great tact and
insight. He always felt the personal situation; divining
the character and aims of his antagonists, and
making his own officers feel that he understood them
and appreciated whatever in them was worthy.</p>

<p class='c012'>In spite of the fact that a boastful spirit is attributed
to Americans, the complete renunciation of external
display so noticeable in General Grant is congenial
to the American mind, and characteristic of a
large proportion of our most successful and admired
men. Undoubtedly our typical hero is the man who
is capable of anything, but thinks it unbecoming to
obtrude the fact. Possibly it is our self-reliant, democratic
mode of life, which, since it offers a constant
and varied test of the realities, as distinct from the
appearances, gives rise to a contempt of the latter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>and of those arts of pretence which impose upon a
less sophisticated people. The truth about us is so
accessible that cant becomes comparatively transparent
and ridiculous.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c013'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>There is no better phenomenon in which to observe
personal ascendency than public speaking.
When a man takes the floor in an assembly, all eyes
are fixed upon him, all imaginations set to work to
divine his personality and significance. If he looks
like a true and steadfast man, of a spirit kindred
with our own, we incline to him before he speaks,
and believe that what he says will be congenial and
right. We have all, probably, seen one arise in the
midst of an audience strange to him, and by his mere
attitude and expression of countenance create a subtle
sense of community and expectation of consent. Another,
on the contrary, will at once impress us as self-conceited,
insincere, over-excited, cold, narrow, or in
some other way out of touch with us, and not likely to
say anything that will suit us. As our first speaker
proceeds, he continues to create a sense that he feels
the situation; we are at home and comfortable with
him, because he seems to be of our sort, having similar
views and not likely to lead us wrong; it is like the
ease and relaxation that one feels among old friends.
There can be no perfect eloquence that does not create
this sense of personal congeniality. But this deference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>to our character and mood is only the basis
for exerting power over us; he is what we are, but is
much more; is decided where we were vacillating,
clear where we were vague, warm where we were
cold. He offers something affirmative and onward,
and gives it the momentum of his own belief. A
man may lack everything but tact and conviction and
still be a forcible speaker; but without these nothing
will avail. “Speak only what you do know and
believe, and are personally in it, and are answerable
for every word.” In comparison with these traits of
mind and character, fluency, grace, logical order, and
the like, are merely the decorative surface of oratory,
which is well enough in its subordinate place, but can
easily be dispensed with. Bismarck was not the less
a great orator because he spoke “with difficulty and
an appearance of struggle,” and Cromwell’s rude eloquence
would hardly have been improved by lessons
in elocution.</p>

<p class='c012'>Burke is an example of a man who appears to have
had all the attributes of a great speaker except tact,
and was conspicuously contrasted in this respect with
Fox, whose genial nature never failed to keep touch
with the situation. A man whose rising makes people
think of going to dinner is not distinctively a
great orator, even though his speeches are an immortal
contribution to literature. The well-known
anecdote of the dagger illustrates the unhappy results
of losing touch with the situation. In the
midst of one of his great discourses on the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Revolution, intending to impress upon his hearers
the bloody character of that movement, Burke drew
from his bosom a dagger and cast it on the floor. It
so happened, however, that the Members of Parliament
present were not just then in the mood to be
duly impressed by this exhibition, which produced
only astonishment and ridicule. Fox could never
have done a thing of this sort. With all Burke’s
greatness, it would seem that there must have been
something narrow, strenuous, and at times even repellent,
in his personality and manner, some lack of
ready fellow-feeling, allowing him to lose that sense
of the situation without which there can hardly be
any face-to-face ascendency.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ascendency which an author exercises over us
by means of the written page is the same in essence
as that of the man of action or the orator. The medium
of communication is different; visible or audible
traits give place to subtler indications. There is
also more time for reflection, and reader or writer can
choose the mood most fit to exert power or to feel it;
so that there is no need for that constant preparedness
and aggressiveness of voice and manner which
the man of action requires. But these are, after all,
incidental differences; and the underlying traits of
personality, the essential relationship between leader
and follower, are much the same as in the other cases.
The reader should feel that the author’s mind and
purpose are congenial with his own, though in the
present direction they go farther, that the thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>communicated is not at all alien, but so truly his that
it offers an opportunity to expand to a wider circle,
and become a completer edition of himself. In short,
if an author is to establish and maintain the power
to interest us and, in his province, to lead our
thought, he must exhibit personal significance and
tact, in a form appropriate to this mode of expression.
He must have a humanity so broad that, in
certain of our moods at least, it gives a sense of congeniality
and at-homeness. He must also make a
novel and characteristic impression of some sort, a
fresh and authentic contribution to our life; and
must, moreover, be wholly himself, “stand united
with his thought,” have that “truth to its type of the
given force” of which Walter Pater speaks. He
must possess belief in something, and simplicity and
boldness in expressing it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Take Darwin again for example, all the better because
it is sometimes imagined that personality is
unimportant in scientific writing. Probably few
thoughtful and open-minded persons can read the
“Origin of Species” without becoming Darwinists,
yielding willingly, for the time at least, to his ascendency,
and feeling him as a master. If we consider
the traits that give him this authority, it will be found
that they are of the same general nature as those
already pointed out. As we read his chapters, and
begin to build him up in our imaginations out of the
subtle suggestions of style, we find ourselves thinking
of him as, first of all, a true and simple man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>a patient, sagacious seeker after the real. This
makes us, so far as we are also simple seekers after
the real, feel at home with him, forget suspicion, and
incline to believe as he believes, even if we fail to understand
his reasons—though no man leaves us less
excuse for such failure. His aim is our aim—the
truth, and as he is far more competent to achieve it
in this field than we are, both because of natural
aptitude and a lifetime of special research, we readily
yield him the reins, the more so because he never
for an instant demands it, but seems to appeal solely
to facts.</p>

<p class='c012'>How many writers are there, even of much ability,
who fail, primarily and irretrievably, because they
do not make this favorable personal impression;
because we divine something insincere, something impatient,
some private aim that is not truth, which
keeps us uncomfortably on our guard and makes us
reluctant to follow them even when they appear most
incontrovertible. Mr. Huxley suggested that Darwin
harmed his case by excessive and unnecessary deference
to the suggestions of his opponents; but it may
well be that in the long run, and with the highest tribunal,
this trait has added to his power. Many men
have been convinced by the character of Darwin, by
his obvious disinterestedness and lack of all controversial
bias, who would never have followed Huxley.
I have had occasion to notice that there is no way of
making converts to the idea of evolution so effectual
as to set people reading the “Origin of Species.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Spencerism comes and goes, but Darwinism is an
abiding condition.</p>

<p class='c012'>Darwin’s intellectual significance no one will question;
and his self-confidence or faith was equally
remarkable, and not at all inconsistent with his
modesty. In his case it seems a faith in truth itself,
so wholly is the self we find in his books identified
with the striving after truth. As an act of faith
his twenty years of collecting and brooding over the
facts bearing upon the principle he had divined, was an
exploit of the same nature as that of Columbus, sailing
westward for months into an unknown ocean,
to a goal which no one else could see. And with
what simple confidence does he take his stand upon
the truth thus won, and apply it to the geological history
of the globe, or the rise of the human body and
mind. A good illustration of his faith is his assertion,
in the face of ridicule, that the existence of an orchid
with a narrow neck eleven inches long proved the
existence of a moth with a tongue of equal length.
The moth, at that time unknown, was subsequently
discovered.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c013'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>To illustrate the same principles in a wholly different
phase of thought, we might take Charles Lamb.
Lamb, too, attracts us first of all by a human and
congenial personality. We feel that in the kinds of
sentiment with which he deals he is at home and
adequate, is ourselves and more than we, with a
deeper pathos, a richer, more audacious humor, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>truer sensibility. He, too, enlarges life by access to
novel and acceptable modes of being; and he is always
boldly and simply himself. It is a poor notion
of Lamb that does not recognize that he was, in his
way, a man of character, conviction, and faith.</p>

<p class='c012'>A similar analysis might be applied to great writers
of other sorts—poets, historians, and moralists; also
to painters, sculptors, actors, singers, to every potent
personality after its kind. While there is infinite
variety in leadership—according to the characters of
the persons concerned, the points at which they come
in contact, the means of communication between
them, and so on—there is, nevertheless, a likeness of
principle everywhere present. There is no such
radical and complete divergence of the conditions of
power in the various fields of activity as is sometimes
imagined. While there are great differences,
they may be looked upon as specific rather than generic.
We may always expect to find a human nature
sufficiently broad and sound—at least in those phases
most apparent in the special means of expression
chosen—to be felt as representative; also some timely
contribution added to the range of thought or
feeling, and faith in or loyalty to this peculiar contribution.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a very natural result of the principles already
noted that the fame and power of a man often transcend
the man himself; that is to say, the personal
idea associated by the world with a particular name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>and presence has often little basis in the mind behind
that name and presence, as it appears to cool
and impartial study. The reason is that the function
of the great and famous man is to be a symbol, and
the real question in other minds is not so much,
What are you? as, What can I believe that you
are? What can you help me to feel and be? How far
can I use you as a symbol in the development of
my instinctive tendency? The scientific historian
may insist on asking, What are you? because the instinct
he is trying to gratify is the need to make
things consistent to the intelligence. But few persons
have this need strongly developed, in comparison
with those of a more emotional character; and
so most will care more for the other questions. The
scientific point of view can never be that of the
most of mankind, and science, it seems to me, can
hardly be more than the critic and chastener of popular
faith, not its leader.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus we may say of all famous and admired characters
that, as personal ideas, they partake of the nature
of gods, in that the thought entertained of them
is a constructive effort of the idealizing imagination
seeking to create a personal symbol of its own tendency.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps there is no more striking illustration of
this than that offered by the mediæval history of the
papacy. It is notorious that the idea of the pope, as
it was entertained by the religious world, and the
pope himself, as he appeared to his intimates, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>things having for the most part no close relation to
each other. The visible pope was often and for long
periods at a time a depraved or insignificant man;
but during these very periods the ideal pope, the
pope of Europe’s thought, might and often did flourish
and grow in temporal and spiritual power. The
former was only a symbol for the better definition of
what the world needed to believe, a lay figure for garments
woven by the co-operative imagination of religious
men. The world needed to believe in a spiritual
authority as a young girl needs to be in love, and
it took up with the papacy as the most available
framework for that belief, just as the young girl is
likely to give her love to the least repugnant of those
who solicit it. The same is true in a large measure
of the other great mediæval authority, the emperor,
as Mr. Bryce so clearly shows in his history
of the Holy Roman Empire; and it holds true in
some degree of all those clothed with royalty or other
great offices. Fame may or may not represent what
men were; but it always represents what humanity
needs them to have been.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is also true that when there is a real personal
superiority, ascendency is seldom confined to the
traits in which this is manifested, but, once established
in regard to these traits, it tends to envelop
the leader as a whole, and to produce allegiance to
him as a concrete person. This comes, of course,
from the difficulty of breaking up and sifting that
which presents itself to the senses, and through them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>to the mind, as a single living whole. And as the
faults and weaknesses of a great man are commonly
much easier to imitate than his excellences, it often
happens, as in the case of Michelangelo, that the
former are much more conspicuous in his followers
than the latter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another phase of the same truth is the ascendency
that persons of belief and hope always exercise as
against those who may be superior in every other respect,
but who lack these traits. The onward and
aggressive portion of the world, the people who do
things, the young and all having surplus energy, need
to hope and strive for an imaginative object, and
they will follow no one who does not encourage this
tendency. The first requisite of a leader is, not to
be right, but to lead, to show a way. The idealist’s
programme of political or economic reform may be
impracticable, absurd, demonstrably ridiculous; but
it can never be successfully opposed merely by pointing
out that this is the case. A negative opposition
cannot be wholly effectual: there must be a competing
idealism; something must be offered that is not
only less objectionable but more desirable, that affords
occupation to progressive instinct. This holds
true, for instance, in the case of teachers. One may
sometimes observe two men of whom one has a
sounder judgment, a clearer head, a more steadfast
character, and is more a master of his subject, than
the other; yet is hopelessly inferior in influence, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the other has a streak of contagious idealism
which he lacks. One has all the virtues except hope;
the other has that and all the power. It has been
well said that when a man ceases to learn—to be open
and forward looking—he should also cease to teach.</p>

<p class='c012'>It would be easy to multiply illustrations of this
simple but important truth. All vigorous minds, I
think, love books and persons that are mentally enfranchising
and onward-looking, that seem to overthrow
the high board fences of conventional thought
and show a distance with purple hills; while it would
be possible to mention powerful minds that have
quickly lost influence by giving too much the impression
of finality, as if they thought their system was
the last. They only build another board fence a
little beyond the old one. Perhaps the most admirable
and original thing about Emerson is the invincible
openness and renewal that seem to be in him, and
some of us find his best expression in that address on
the “Method of Nature” in which, even more than
elsewhere, he makes us feel that what is achieved is
ever transitory, and that there is everything to expect
from the future. In like manner, to take perhaps
the most remarkable example of all, the early Christians
found in their belief organized hope, in contrast
to the organized <em>ennui</em> of the Roman system of
thought, and this, it would seem, must have been its
most direct and potent appeal to most minds.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c013'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>It is also because of this ideal and imaginative
character in personal ascendency that mystery enters
so largely into it. Our allegiance is accompanied by
a mental enlargement and renewal through generative
suggestions; we are passing from the familiar to the
strange, are being drawn we know not whither by
forces never before experienced; the very essence of
the matter is novelty, insecurity, and that excitement
in the presence of dim possibilities that constitutes
mystery.</p>

<p class='c012'>It has often been remarked that to one in love
the beloved person appears as a mystery, enveloped,
as it were, in a sort of purple cloud. This is
doubtless because the lover is undergoing strange
alteration in his own mind; fresh vague passions are
rising into consciousness out of the dark storehouse
of hereditary instinct; he is cast loose from his old
anchorage and does not know whither he is driven.
The consequent feeling of a power and a strangeness
upon him he associates, of course, with the person—commonplace
enough, perhaps, to others—who is the
symbol and occasion of the experience. Goethe seems
to mean something of this sort when he uses the expression
<em>das ewig Weibliche</em> to suggest the general
mystery and allurement of new life.</p>

<p class='c012'>And it is much the same no matter what sort of ascendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>is exercised over us; there is always excitement
and a feeling of newness and uncertainty,
imagination is awakened and busies itself with the
fascinating personality; his slightest word or action
is eagerly interpreted and works upon us. In short,
mystery and idealism are so inseparable that a sense
of power in others seems to involve a sense of their
inscrutability; and, on the other hand, so soon as a
person becomes plain, he ceases to stimulate the imagination;
we have seen all around him, so that he
no longer appears an open door to new life, but has
begun to be commonplace and stale.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is even true that inscrutability in itself, having
perhaps nothing important back of it, plays a considerable
part in personal ascendency. The hero is
always a product of constructive imagination; and
just as some imaginative painters find that the too
detailed observation of sensible objects cumbers the
inner vision and impedes production, so the hero-worshipper
is likely at times to reject altogether the
persons he knows in favor of some sort of mask or lay
figure, whose very blankness or inertness insures to it
the great advantage that it cannot actively repudiate
the qualities attributed to it: it offers <em>carte blanche</em>
to the imagination. As already suggested, the vital
question in ascendency is not, primarily, What are
you? but, What do you enable me to be? What self-developing
ideas do you enable me to form? and the
power of mere inscrutability arises from the fact that
it gives a vague stimulus to thought and then leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>it to work out the details to suit itself. To recur to
the matter of falling in love: the young girl who,
like Gwendolen in “Daniel Deronda,” or Isabel in the
“Portrait of a Lady,” fixes her passion upon some self-contained
and to her inscrutable person, in preference
to others who are worthier but less mysterious, is a
common character in life as well as in fiction.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many other illustrations of the same principle
might be given. Thus the fact, instances of which
are collected by Mr. Tylor in his work on “Primitive
Culture,” that the insane, the idiotic, and the epileptic
are reverenced by primitive peoples, may be interpreted
in a similar manner.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c013'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Those who are mentally
abnormal present in a striking form the inscrutable
in personality; they seem to be men, but are not such
men as we; our imaginations are alarmed and baffled,
so that it is not unnatural that before science has
shown us definite relations between these persons and
ourselves, they should serve as one of the points about
which crystallize our imaginations of unknown power.
In the same way a strange and somewhat impassive
physiognomy is often, perhaps, an advantage to an
orator, or leader of any sort, because it helps to fix
the eye and fascinate the mind. Such a countenance
as that of Savonarola may have counted for much
toward the effect he produced. Another instance of
the prestige of the inscrutable is the fascination of
silence, when power is imagined to lie behind it. The
very name of William the Silent gives one a sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>thrill, whether he knows anything of that distinguished
character or not. One seems to see a man
darkly potent, mysteriously dispensing with the ordinary
channel of self-assertion, and attaining his ends
without evident means. It is the same with Von
Moltke, “silent in seven languages,” whose genius
humbled France and Austria in two brief campaigns.
And General Grant’s taciturnity undoubtedly fascinated
the imagination of the people—after his earlier
successes had shown that there was really something
in him—and helped to secure to him a trust and authority
much beyond that of any other of the Federal
generals. It is the same with personal reserve in
every form: one who always appears to be his own
master and does not too readily reveal his deeper
feelings, is so much the more likely to create an impression
of power. He is formidable because incalculable.
And accordingly we see that many people
deliberately assume, or try to assume, an appearance
of inscrutability,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And do a wilful stillness entertain,</div>
      <div class='line'>With purpose to be dressed in an opinion</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Disraeli, it is said, “was a mystery man by instinct
and policy,” and we all know others in our own circle
of acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c012'>So with the expression of personality in literature.
A book which is perfectly clear at the first cursory
reading is by that fact condemned as commonplace.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>If there were anything vital in it, it would appear at
least a little strange, and would not be fully understood
until it had been for some time inwardly digested.
At the end of that time it would have done
its best service for us and its ascendency would have
waned. It is always thus, I imagine, with writers
who strongly move us; there is first mystery and a
sense of unexplored life, then a period of assimilative
excitement, and after that chastened affection, or perhaps
revulsion or distrust. A person of mature years
and ripe development, who is expecting nothing from
literature but the corroboration and renewal of past
ideas, may find satisfaction in a lucidity so complete
as to occasion no imaginative excitement, but young
and ambitious students are not content with it. They
seek the excitement because they are capable of the
growth that it accompanies. It was a maxim of Goethe
that where there is no mystery there is no power;
and something of the perennial vitality of his writings
may be attributed to the fact that he did not
trouble himself too much with the question whether
people would understand him, but set down his inmost
experiences as adequately as he could, and left
the rest to time. The same may be said of Browning,
and of many other great writers.</p>

<p class='c012'>Something similar holds true of power in plastic
art. The sort of mystery most proper and legitimate
in art, however, is not an intellectual mystery—though
some artists have had a great deal of that, like
Leonardo, who “conquered by the magnetism of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>incalculable personality”<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c013'><sup>[90]</sup></a>—but rather a sensuous
mystery, that is to say a vague and subtle appeal to
recondite sources of sensuous impression, an awakening
of hitherto unconscious capacity for harmonious
sensuous life, like the feeling we get from the first
mild weather in the spring. In this way, it seems to
me, there is an effect of mystery, of congenial strangeness,
in all powerful art. Probably everyone would
recognize this as true of music, even if all do not feel
its applicability to painting, sculpture and architecture.</p>

<p class='c012'>The well-known fact that mystery is inseparable
from higher religious idealism may be regarded as a
larger expression of this same necessity of associating
inscrutability with personal power. If the imagination
cannot be content with the definite in lesser
instances, it evidently cannot when it comes to form
the completest image of personality that it can embrace.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although ascendency depends upon what we think
about a man rather than what he is, it is nevertheless
true that an impression of his reality and good faith
is of the first importance, and this impression can
hardly outlast close scrutiny unless it corresponds to
the fact. Hence, as a rule, the man who is to exercise
enduring power over others must believe in that for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>which he stands. Such belief operates as a potent
suggestion upon the minds of others.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“While thus he spake, his eye, dwelling on mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drew me, with power upon me, till I grew</div>
      <div class='line'>One with him, to believe as he believed.”<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c013'><sup>[91]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>If we divine a discrepancy between a man’s words
and his character, the whole impression of him becomes
broken and painful; he revolts the imagination
by his lack of unity, and even the good in him is
hardly accepted. Nothing, therefore, is more fatal
to ascendency than perceived insincerity or doubt,
and in immediate intercourse it is hard to conceal
them. When Luther came to Rome and saw what
kind of a man the Pope was, the papacy was shaken.</p>

<p class='c012'>How far it is possible for a man to work upon
others through a false idea of himself depends upon
a variety of circumstances. As already pointed out,
the man himself may be a mere incident with no definite
relation to the idea of him, the latter being a
separate product of the imagination. This can hardly
be except where there is no immediate contact between
leader and follower, and partly explains why
authority, especially if it covers intrinsic personal
weakness, has always a tendency to surround itself
with forms and artificial mystery, whose object is to
prevent familiar contact and so give the imagination
a chance to idealize. Among a self-reliant, practical
people like ours, with much shrewdness and little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>traditional reverence, the power of forms is diminished;
but it is always great. The discipline of
armies and navies, for instance, very distinctly recognizes
the necessity of those forms which separate
superior from inferior, and so help to establish an
unscrutinized ascendency in the former. In the same
way manners, as Professor Ross remarks in his work
on “Social Control,”<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c013'><sup>[92]</sup></a> are largely used by men of the
world as a means of self-concealment, and this self-concealment
serves, among other purposes, that of
preserving a sort of ascendency over the unsophisticated.</p>

<p class='c012'>As regards intentional imposture, it may be said in
general that all men are subject to be duped in matters
of which they have no working knowledge and
which appeal strongly to the emotions. The application
of this principle to quack medicine, to commercial
swindles, and to the ever-reappearing impostures
relating to supposed communication with spirits, is
too plain to be enlarged upon. While it is an advantage,
even to a charlatan, to believe in himself,
the susceptibility of a large part of us to be duped
by quacks of one sort or another is obvious enough,
and shows that the work of free institutions in developing
shrewdness is by no means complete.</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably a close and candid consideration of the
matter would lead to the conclusion that everyone is
something of an impostor, that we all pose more or
less, under the impulse to produce a desired impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>upon others. As social and imaginative
beings we must set store by our appearance; and it
is hardly possible to do so without in some degree
adapting that appearance to the impression we wish
to make. It is only when this adaptation takes the
form of deliberate and injurious deceit that much
fault can be found with it. “We all,” says Stevenson
in his essay on Pepys, “whether we write or speak,
must somewhat drape ourselves when we address our
fellows; at a given moment we apprehend our character
and acts by some particular side; we are merry
with one, grave with another, as befits the nature and
demands of the relation.” If we never tried to seem
a little better than we are, how could we improve or
“train ourselves from the outside inward”? And the
same impulse to show the world a better or idealized
aspect of ourselves finds an organized expression in
the various professions and classes, each of which
has to some extent a cant or pose, which its members
assume unconsciously, for the most part, but which
has the effect of a conspiracy to work upon the credulity
of the rest of the world. There is a cant not
only of theology and of philanthropy, but also of law,
medicine, teaching, even of science—perhaps especially
of science, just now, since the more a particular
kind of merit is recognized and admired, the more it
is likely to be assumed by the unworthy. As theology
goes down and science comes up, the affectation of disinterestedness
and of exactness in method tends to
supplant the affectation of piety.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>In general it may be said that imposture is of considerable
but always secondary importance; it is a
sort of parasite upon human idealism and thrives only
by the impulse to believe. A correct intuition on
the part of mankind in the choice of their leaders is
the only guaranty of the effectual organization of life
in any or every sphere; and in the long run and on
a large scale this correctness seems to exist. On the
whole, the great men of history were real men, not
shams, their characters were genuinely representative
of the deeper needs and tendencies of human nature,
so that in following them men were truly expressing
themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have seen that all leadership has an aspect of
sympathy and conformity, as well as one of individuality
and self-will, so that every leader must also be
a follower, in the sense that he shares the general
current of life. He leads by appealing to our own
tendency, not by imposing something external upon
us. Great men are therefore the symbols or expressions,
in a sense, of the social conditions, under
which they work, and if these conditions were not
favorable the career of the great man would be impossible.</p>

<p class='c012'>Does the leader, then, really lead, in the sense that
the course of history would have been essentially
different if he had not lived? Is the individual a
true cause, or would things have gone on about the
same if the famous men had been cut off in infancy?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Is not general tendency the great thing, and is it not
bound to find expression independently of particular
persons? Certainly many people have the impression
that in an evolutionary view of life single individuals
become insignificant, and that all great
movements must be regarded as the outcome of
vast, impersonal tendencies.</p>

<p class='c012'>If one accepts the view of the relation between particular
individuals and society as a whole already
stated in various connections, the answer to these
questions must be that the individual <em>is</em> a cause, as
independent as a cause can be which is part of a
living whole, that the leader does lead, and that the
course of history must have been notably different if
a few great men had been withdrawn from it.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to general tendency, it is false to set it over
against individuals, as if it were a separate thing; it
is only through individuals that general tendency
begins or persists. “Impersonal tendency” in society
is a mere abstraction; there is no such thing.
Whether idiosyncrasy is such as we all have in some
measure, or whether it takes the form of conspicuous
originality or genius, it is a variant element in life
having always some tendency to innovation. Of
course, if we believe in the prevalence of continuity
and law, we cannot regard it as a new creation out of
nothing; it must be a reorganization of hereditary
and social forces. But however this may be, the
person as a whole is always more or less novel or
innovating. Not one of us floats quite inert upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>the general stream of tendency; we leave the world
somewhat different from what it would have been if
we had been carried off by the croup.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now in the case of a man of genius, this variant
tendency may be so potent as to reorganize a large
part of the general life in its image, and give it a
form and direction which it could not have had otherwise.
How anyone can look at the facts and doubt
the truth of this it is hard to see. Would the life we
receive from the last century have been the same if,
say, Darwin, Lincoln, and Bismarck had not lived?
Take the case of Darwin. No doubt his greatness
depended upon his representing and fulfilling an existing
tendency, and this tendency entered into him
from his environment, that is from other individuals.
But it came out of him no longer the vague drift
toward evolutionary theory and experiment that it
was before, but concrete, common-sense, matter-of-fact
knowledge, thoroughly Darwinized, and so accredited
by his character and labors that the world
accepts it as it could not have done if he had not
lived. We may apply the same idea to the author
of Christianity. Whatever we may or may not believe
regarding the nature of Christ’s spiritual leadership,
there is, I take it, nothing necessarily at variance with
a sound social science in the Christian theory that
the course of history has been transformed by his
life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The vague instincts which it is the function of the
leader to define, stimulate and organize, might have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>remained latent and ineffectual, or might have developed
in a totally different manner, if he had not lived.
No one can guess what the period following the
French Revolution, or any period of French history
since then, might have been without Napoleon; but
it is apparent that all would have been very different.
It is true that the leader is always a symbol, and can
work only by using existing elements of life; but in
the peculiar way in which he uses those elements is
causation, is creation, in the only sense, perhaps, in
which creation is definitely conceivable. To deny its
importance is as absurd as to say that the marble
as it comes from the quarry and the marble after
Michelangelo is through with it, are one and the
same thing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Most, if not all, of our confusion regarding such
points as these arises from the almost invincible
habit of thinking of “society,” or “historical tendency,”
as a distinct entity from “individuals,” instead
of remembering that these general and particular
terms merely express different aspects of the same
concrete fact—human life. In studying leadership
we may examine the human army one by one, and inquire
why certain persons stand out from the rest as
captains, colonels, or generals, and what, in particular,
it is that they have to do; or, in studying social
tendency, we may disregard individuality and look at
the movements of the army, or of its divisions and
regiments, as if they were impersonal wholes. But
there is no separation in fact: the leader is always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the nucleus of a tendency, and, on the other hand, all
social movement, closely examined, will be found to
consist of tendencies having such nuclei. It is never
the case that mankind move in any direction with an
even front, but there are always those who go before
and show the way.</p>

<p class='c012'>I need hardly add that leadership is not a <em>final</em> explanation
of anything; but is simply one of many
aspects in which human life, always inscrutable, may
be studied. In these days we no longer look for final
explanations, but are well content if we can get a
glimpse of things in process, not expecting to know
how they began or where they are to end. The
leader is a cause, but, like all causes we know of, he
is also an effect. His being, however original, is
rooted in the past of the race, and doubtless as
susceptible of explanation as anything else, if we
could only get at the facts.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c009'>THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF CONSCIENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Right as the Rational—Significance of this View—The
Right as the Onward—The Right as Habit—Right is not
the Social as against the Individual—It is, in a Sense,
the Social as against the Sensual—The Right as a Synthesis
of Personal Influences—Personal Authority—Confession,
Prayer, Publicity—Truth—Dependence of
Right upon Imagination—Conscience Reflects a Social
Group—Ideal Persons as Factors in Conscience.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>I agree with those moralists who hold that what
we judge to be the right is simply the rational, in a
large sense of that word. The mind is the theatre of
conflict for an infinite number of impulses, variously
originating, among which it is ever striving to produce
some sort of unification or harmony. This
endeavor to harmonize or assimilate includes deliberate
reasoning, but is something much more general
and continuous than that. It is mostly an unconscious
or subconscious manipulation of the materials
presented, an unremitting comparison and rearrangement
of them, which ever tends to organize them
into some sort of a whole. The right, then, is that
which stands this test; the sanction of conscience
attaches to those thoughts which, in the long run,
maintain their places as part of that orderly whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>which the mental instinct calls for, and which it is
ever working with more or less success to build up.
That is right which presents itself, after the mind
has done its full work upon the matter, as the mentally
necessary, which we cannot gainsay without
breaking up our mental integrity.</p>

<p class='c012'>According to this view of the matter, judgments of
right and wrong are in no way isolated or radically
different in kind from other judgments. Such peculiarity
as they have seems to come chiefly from the
unusual intensity of the mental conflict that precedes
them. The slightest scrutiny of experience shows,
it seems to me, that the sharp and absolute distinction
often assumed to exist between conscience and
other mental activities does not hold good in life.
There are gradual transitions from judgments which
no one thinks of as peculiarly moral, through others
which some would regard as moral and others would
not, to those which are universally so regarded; and
likewise moral feeling or sentiment varies a good deal
in different individuals, and in the same individual
under different conditions.</p>

<p class='c012'>The class of judgments which everyone considers
as moral is perhaps limited to such as follow an exciting
and somewhat protracted mental struggle, involving
an imaginative weighing of conflicting personal
ideas. A line of conduct has to be chosen;
alternatives present themselves, each of which is
backed by strong impulses, among which are some,
at least, of sympathetic origin; the mind is intensely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>even painfully, aroused, and when a decision is
reached, it is accompanied by a somewhat peculiar
sort of feeling called the sense of obligation, duty,
or right. There would be little agreement, however,
as to what sort of situations evoke this feeling. We
are apt to feel that any question in regard to which
we are much in earnest is a question of right and
wrong. To the artist a consciously false stroke of
brush or chisel is a moral wrong, a sin; and a good
carpenter will suffer remorse if he lets a bad joint go
uncorrected.</p>

<p class='c012'>The fact that the judgment of right is likely to
present itself to people of emotional temperament
as an imagined voice, admonishing them what they
ought to do, is an illustration of that essentially social
or interlocutory character of thought, spoken of in
an earlier chapter. Our thoughts are always, in some
sort, imaginary conversations; and when vividly felt
they are likely to become quite distinctly so. On
the other hand, people whose moral life is calm perceive
little or no distinction, in this regard, between
the conclusions of conscience and other judgments.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, the view that the right is the rational
would be untrue, if by rational were meant merely
the result of formal reasoning. The judgment of
right and the conclusion of formal thought are frequently
opposed to each other, because, I take it, the
latter is a comparatively narrow, partial, and conventional
product of the mind. The former is rational
and mentally authoritative in a larger sense; its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>premises are immeasurably richer; it deals with the
whole content of life, with instincts freighted with the
inarticulate conclusions of a remote past, and with
the unformulated inductions of individual experience.
To set the product of a superficial ratiocination over
the final output, in conscience, of our whole mental
being, is a kind of pedantry. I do not mean to imply
that there is usually an opposition between the
two—they should work harmoniously together—but
only to assert that when there is, conscience must
be regarded as of a profounder rationality.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, the wrong, the immoral, is, in a
similar sense, the irrational. It is that which, after the
mind has done its full work upon the matter, presents
itself as the mentally isolated, the inharmonious, that
which we cannot follow without having, in our more
collected moods, a sense of having been untrue to ourselves,
of having done ourselves a harm. The mind
in its fullest activity is denied and desecrated; we
are split in two. To violate conscience is to act under
the control of an incomplete and fragmentary state
of mind; and so to become less a person, to begin to
disintegrate and go to pieces. An unjust or incontinent
deed produces remorse, apparently because the
thought of it will not lie still in the mind, but is of such
a nature that there is no comfortable place for it in
the system of thought already established there.</p>

<p class='c012'>The question of right and wrong, as it presents itself
to any particular mind, is, then, a question of the
completest practicable organization of the impulses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>with which that mind finds itself compelled to deal.
The working out of the right conclusion may be compared
to the process by which a deliberative body
comes to a conclusion upon some momentous public
measure. Time must be given for all the more
important passions, prejudices, traditions, interests,
and the like, to be urged upon the members with
such cogency as their advocates can give them, and
for attempts to harmonize these conflicting forces
so that a measure can be framed which the body can
be induced to pass. And when a decision is finally
reached there is a sense of relief, the greater in proportion
as the struggle has been severe, and a tendency,
even on the part of the opposition, to regard
the matter as settled. Those people who cannot
achieve moral unity, but have always a sense of two
personalities warring within them, may be compared
to certain countries in whose assemblies political parties
are so embittered that they never come to an
understanding with one another.</p>

<p class='c012'>The mental process is, of course, only the proximate
source of the idea of right, the conflict by which
the competitive strength of the various impulses is
measured, and some combination of them achieved;
behind it is the whole history of the race and of the
individual, in which impulses are rooted. Instinctive
passions, like love, ambition, and revenge; the
momentum of habit, the need of change, personal ascendencies,
and the like, all have their bearing upon
the final synthesis, and must either be conciliated or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>suppressed. Thus in case of a strong passion, like
revenge let us say, one of two things is pretty sure to
happen; either it will succeed in getting its revengeful
impulse, more or less disguised perhaps, judged
as right; or, if opposing ideas prove stronger, revenge
will be kept under by the rise of an intense
feeling of wrong that associates itself with it. If one
observes that a person has a very vivid sense of the
wrong of some particular impulse, one may usually
infer that he has had in some way to contend with it;
either as a temptation in his own mind, or as injuriously
manifested in the conduct of others.</p>

<p class='c012'>The natural way to solve a moral question, when
immediate action is not required, is to let it lie in the
mind, turning it over from time to time as attention
is directed to it. In this manner the new situation
gradually relates itself to all the mental forces having
pertinency to it. The less violent but more persistent
tendencies connect themselves quietly but firmly
to recalcitrant impulse, enwrapping it like the filaments
of a spider’s web, and bringing it under discipline.
Something of this sort is implied in the rule of conduct
suggested by Mr. H. R. Marshall, in his excellent
work, “Instinct and Reason”: “Act to restrain the
impulses which demand immediate reaction, in order
that the impulse order determined by the existence
of impulses of less strength, but of wider significance,
may have full weight in the guidance of your life.”<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c013'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>It occurs to me, however, that there is no absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>rule that the right is the deliberate. It is usually so,
because the danger of irrationality and disintegration
comes, in most cases, from the temporary sway
of some active impulse, like that to strike or use
injurious words in anger. But rationality involves
decision as well as deliberation; and there are persons
in whom the impulse to meditate and ponder so
much outweighs the impulse to decide and act, as
itself to endanger the unity of life. Such a person
may well come to feel that the right is the decisive.
It seems likely that in most minds the larger rationality,
which gives the sense of right, is the sequel of
much pondering, but is definitely achieved in moments
of vivid insight.</p>

<p class='c011'>The main significance of the view that the right is
the rational is to deny that there is any sharp distinction
in kind between the question of right and
wrong and other mental questions; the conclusion of
conscience being held to be simply a more comprehensive
judgment, reached by the same process as other
judgments. It still leaves untouched the remoter
problems, mental and social, underlying all judgments;
as, for instance, of the nature of impulses, of
what determines their relative intensity and persistence,
of the character of that process of competition
and assimilation among them of which judgments are
the outcome; and of the social order as determining
impulses both indirectly, through its action upon
heredity, and directly through suggestion.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>And behind these is that problem of problems, to
which all the roads of thought lead, that question of
organization or vital process, of which all special
questions of society or of the mind are phases. From
whatever point of view we look at life, we can see
something going on which it is convenient to call organization,
development, or the like; but I suppose
that all who have thought much about the matter feel
that we have only a vague notion of what the fact is
that lies behind these words.</p>

<p class='c012'>I mention these things merely to disclaim any present
attempt to fathom them, and to point out that
the aim of this chapter is limited to some observations
on the working of social or personal factors in
the particular sort of organization which we call conscience
or moral judgment.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is useless to look for any other or higher criterion
of right than conscience. What is felt to be
right is right; that is what the word means. Any
theory of right that should turn out to be irreconcilable
with the sense of right must evidently be
judged as false. And when it is urged that conscience
is variable, we can only answer that, for this
very reason, the right cannot be reduced to a universal
and conclusive formula. Like life in all its
phases, it is a progressive revelation out of depths we
do not penetrate.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the individual considering his own conduct,
his conscience is the only possible moral guide, and
though it differ from that of everyone else, it is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>only right there is for him; to violate it is to commit
moral suicide. Speculating more largely on conduct
in general he may find the right in some collective
aspect of conscience, in which his own conscience
appears as member of a larger whole; and
with reference to which certain particular consciences,
at variance with his own, like those of certain sorts
of criminals, may appear as degenerate or wrong—and
this will not surprise him, because science teaches
us to expect degenerate variations in all forms of
life. But, however broad a view he takes, he cannot
do otherwise than refer the matter to his conscience;
so that what I think, or—to generalize it—what <em>we</em>
think, must, in one form or another, be the arbiter of
right and wrong, so far as there can be any. Other
tests become valid only in so far as conscience adopts
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>It would seem that any scientific study of the matter
must consist essentially in investigating the conditions
and relations of concrete right—the when,
where, and why of what people <em>do</em> think is right. Social
or moral science can never be a final source or
test of morality; though it can reveal facts and relations
which may help conscience in making its authoritative
judgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The view that the right is the rational is quite consistent
with the fact that, for those who have surplus
energy, the right is the <em>onward</em>. The impulse to act,
to become, to let out the life that rises within from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>obscure springs of power, is the need of needs, underlying
all more special impulses; and this onward
<em>Trieb</em> must always count in our judgments of right:
it is one of the things conscience has to make room
for. There can be no harmony in a mental life which
denies expression to this most persistent and fundamental
of all instinctive tendencies: and consequently
the equilibrium which the active mind seeks, and a
sense of which is one with the sense of right, is never
a state of rest, but an <em>equilibrium mobile</em>. Our situation
may be said to resemble that of an acrobat balancing
himself upon a rolling sphere, and enabled
to stand upright only on condition of moving continually
forward. The right never remains precisely the
same two days in succession; but as soon as any particular
state of right is achieved, the mental centre of
gravity begins to move onward and away from it, so
that we can hold our ground only by effecting a new
adjustment. Hence the merely negative can never be
the right to a vigorous person, or to a vigorous society,
because the mind will not be content with anything
so inadequate to its own nature. The good self
must be what Emerson calls a “crescive self,” and
the right must mark a track across the “waste abyss
of possibility” and lead out the energies to congenial
exertion.</p>

<p class='c012'>This idea is nowhere, perhaps, more cogently stated
and illustrated than in M. Guyau’s penetrating work,
“A Sketch of Morality.” He holds that the sense of
duty is, in one aspect, a sense of a power to do things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>and that this power tends in itself to create a sense
of obligation. We can, therefore we must. “Obligation
is an internal expansion—a need to complete
our ideas by converting them into action.”<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c013'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Even
pain may be sought as part of that larger life which
the growing mind requires. “Leopardi, Heine,
or Lenau would probably not have exchanged
those hours of anguish in which they composed
their finest songs for the greatest possible enjoyment.
Dante suffered.... Which of us would
not undergo a similar suffering? Some heart-aches
are infinitely sweet.”<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c013'><sup>[95]</sup></a> And so with benevolence
and what is called self-sacrifice. “... charity
is but one with overflowing fecundity; it is like a
maternity too large to be confined within the family.
The mother’s breast needs life eager to empty it; the
heart of the truly humane creature needs to be gentle
and helpful to all.”<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c013'><sup>[96]</sup></a> “The young man is full of enthusiasm;
he is ready for every sacrifice because, in
point of fact, it is necessary that he should sacrifice
something of himself—that he should diminish himself
to a certain extent; he is too full of life to live
only for himself.”<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c013'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The right, then, is not merely the repressive discipline
with which we sometimes identify it, but is
also something warm, fresh and outward-looking.
That which we somewhat vaguely and coldly call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>mental development is, when at its best, the revelation
of an expanding, variegating, and beautiful whole,
of which the right act is a harmonious member.</p>

<p class='c011'>When, on the other hand, we say that right is
largely determined by habit, we only emphasize the
other aspect of that progressive mingling of continuity
with change, which we see in mental life in all its
phases. Habit, we know, makes lines of less resistance
in thought, feeling, and action; and the existence
of these tracks must always count in the formation of
a judgment of right, as of any other judgment. It
ought not, apparently, to be set over against novel
impulses as a contrary principle, but rather thought
of as a phase of all impulses, since novelty always
consists, from one point of view, in a fresh combination
of habits. It is much the same question as that
of suggestion and choice, or of invention and imitation.
The concrete fact, the real thing, in each case,
is not one of these as against the other, or one modified
by the other, but a single, vital act of which these
are aspects, having no separate existence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whether a person’s life, in its moral or any other
aspect, is obviously changeful, or, on the contrary,
appears to be merely repetitive or habitual, depends
upon whether the state of his mind, and of the conditions
about it, are favorable to rapid changes in the
system of his thought. Thus if he is young and vigorous,
and if he has a natural open-mindedness and
keenness of sensibility, he will be so much the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>likely, other things equal, to incorporate fresh elements
of thought and make a new synthesis, instead
of running on habit. Variety of life in the past,
preventing excessive deepening of the mental ruts,
and contact with strong and novel influences in the
present, have the same tendency.</p>

<p class='c012'>The rigidly habitual or traditionary morality of
savages is apparently a reflection of the restriction
and sameness of their social life; and a similar type
of morals is found even in a complex society, as in
China, when the social system has become rigid by the
equilibration of competing ideas. On the other hand,
the stir and change of the more active parts of our
society make control by mere habit impossible.
There are no simple dominant habits; tendencies
are mixed and conflicting, so that the person must
either be intelligently moral or else degenerate. He
must either make a fresh synthesis or have no synthesis
at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>What is called principle appears to be simply a
habit of conscience, a rule formed originally by a
synthesis of various impulses, but become somewhat
mechanical and independent of its origin—as it is
the nature of habit to do. As the mind hardens
and matures there is a growing inaptitude to take in
novel and powerful personal impressions, and a corresponding
ascendency of habit and system; social
sentiment, the flesh and blood of conduct, partly falls
away, exposing a skeleton of moral principles. The
sense of duty presents itself less and less as a vivid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>sympathetic impulse, and more and more as a sense
of the economy and restfulness of a definite standard
of conduct. When one has come to accept a certain
course as duty he has a pleasant sense of relief and
of lifted responsibility, even if the course involves
pain and renunciation. It is like obedience to some
external authority; any clear way, though it lead to
death, is mentally preferable to the tangle of uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c012'>Actions that appear memorable or heroic are seldom
achieved at the moment of decisive choice, but
are more likely to come after the habit of thought
which produces the action has become somewhat mechanical
and involuntary. It is probably a mistake
to imagine that the soldier who braves death in battle,
the fireman who enters the burning building, the
brakeman who pursues his duty along the icy top of
a moving train, or the fisherman who rows away from
his vessel into the storm and mist, is usually in an
acute state of heroism. It is all in the day’s work;
the act is part of a system of thought and conduct
which has become habitual and would be painful to
break. Death is not imagined in all its terrors and
compared with social obligation; the case is far simpler.
As a rule there is no time in a crisis for complicated
mental operations, and whether the choice
is heroic or cowardly it is sure to be simple. If
there is any conflict of suggestions it is brief, and the
one that gains ascendency is likely to be followed
mechanically, without calculation of the future.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>One who studies the “sense of oughtness” in children
will have no difficulty in seeing that it springs
largely from a reluctance to break habits, an indisposition,
that is, to get out of mental ruts. It is in the
nature of the mind to seek a principle or unifying
thought—the mind is a rule-demanding instinct—and
in great part this need is met by a habit of
thought, inculcated perhaps by some older person
who proclaims and enforces the rule, or perhaps by
the unintended pressure of conditions which emphasize
one suggestion and shut out others. However
the rule originates, it meets a mental want, and, if
not too strongly opposed by other impulses, is likely
to be adopted and felt as obligatory just because it
is a consistent way of thinking. As Mr. Sully says,
“The truth is that children have a tremendous belief
in law.”<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c013'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The books on child-study give many instances of
the surprising allegiance which children often give to
rule, merely as rule, and even an intermittent observer
will be sure to corroborate them. Thus a
child five years old, when on a visit, was invited to
“open his mouth and shut his eyes,” and upon his
doing so a piece of candy was put into the former.
When he tasted it he pulled it out and exclaimed,
“Mamma don’t want me to have candy.” Now this
did not seem to be affectation, nor was the child
other than fond of sweets, nor afraid of punishment
or blame; he was simply under the control of a need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>for mental consistency. The no-candy rule had been
promulgated and enforced at home; he had adopted
it as part of his system of thought, and, when it was
broken, his moral sense, otherwise the harmony of his
mind, was shocked to a degree that the sweet taste
of the candy could not overcome. Again, R. was subjected
nearly every evening for several years to a
somewhat painful operation called “bending his
foot,” intended to correct a slight deformity. After
becoming accustomed to this he would sometimes
protest and even cry if it were proposed to omit it.
I thought I could see that moral allegiance to a rule,
merely as such, weakened as he grew older; and
the explanation of this I took to be that the increasing
competition of suggestions and conflict of precepts
made this simple, mechanical unity impossible,
and so forced the mind, still striving for harmony, to
exert its higher organizing activity and attempt a
larger sort of unification. It is the same principle as
that which prevents the civilized man from retaining
the simple allegiance to rule and habit that the savage
has; his complex life cannot be unified in this
way, any more than his accounts can be notched on a
stick; and he is forced, if he is to achieve any unity
of life, to seek it in some more elaborate standard
of behavior. Under uniform conditions the habitual
is the rational, and therefore the moral; but under
complex conditions this ceases to be the case.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course this way of looking at the matter does
not do away with all the difficulties involved in it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>but does, it seems to me, put habitual and other morality
on the common ground of rationality, and show
the apparently sharp division between them to be an
illusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who think as I do will reject the opinion
that the right is, in any general sense, the social as
opposed to the individual. As already stated, I look
upon this antithesis as false when used to imply a
radical opposition. All our human thought and activity
is either individual or social, according to how
you look at it, the two being no more than phases of
the same thing, which common thought, always inclined
to confuse words with things, attempts to separate.
This is as true in the ethical field as in any
other. The consideration of other persons usually
enters largely into questions of right and wrong; but
the ethical decision is distinctly an assertion of a private,
individualized view of the matter. Surely there
is no sound general principle in accordance with
which the right is represented by the suggestions of
the social environment, and the wrong by our more
private impulses.</p>

<p class='c012'>The right is always a private impulse, always a
self-assertion, with no prejudice, however, to its social
character. The “ethical self” is not less a self for
being ethical, but if anything more of a self, because
it is a fuller, more highly organized expression of
personality. All will recognize, I imagine, that a
strong sense of duty involves self-feeling, so that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>say to ourselves emphatically I ought. It would be
no sense of duty at all if we did not feel that there
was something about it peculiar to us and antithetical
to some of the influences acting upon us. It is important
for many purposes to emphasize the fact that
the ethical self is always a public self; but it is
equally true and important that it is always a private
self.</p>

<p class='c012'>In short, ethical thinking and feeling, like all our
higher life, has its individual and social aspects,
with no peculiar emphasis on either. If the social
aspect is here at its highest, so also is the individual
aspect.</p>

<p class='c012'>The same objection applies to any form of the
antithesis self <em>versus</em> other, considered as a general
statement of moral situations. It is a fallacious one,
involving vague and material notions of what personality
is—vague because material, for we cannot, I
think, reflect closely upon the facts of personality
without seeing that they are primarily mental or
spiritual, and by no means even analogous to the
more obvious aspects of the physical. As a matter
of fact, ego and alter, self and sympathy, are correlative,
and always mingled in ethical judgments, which
are not distinguished by having less self and more
other in them, but by being a completer synthesis of
all pertinent impulses. The characteristic of a sense
of right is not ego or alter, individual or social, but
mental unification, and the peculiar feeling that accompanies
it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Egoism can be identified with wrong only when
we mean by it some narrow or unstable phase of the
self; and altruism, if we take it to mean susceptibility
to be impressed by other people, is equally
wrong when it, in turn, becomes narrow or unstable,
as we see it in hysterical persons. As I have already
said, I hold altruism, when used, as it seems
to be ordinarily, to denote a supposed peculiar class
of impulses, separate from another supposed class
called egoistic, to be a mere fiction, engendered by
the vaguely material idea of personality just mentioned.
Most higher kinds of thought are altruistic,
in the sense that they involve a more or less distinct
reference to other persons; but when intensely conceived,
these same kinds of thought are usually, if
not always, self-thoughts, or egoistic, as well.</p>

<p class='c012'>The question whether a man shall keep his dollar
or give it to a beggar, for example, looks at first sight
like a question of ego <em>versus</em> alter, because there are
two physical bodies present and visibly associated
with the conflicting impulses. In this merely physical
sense, of referring to one material body rather
than another, it is in fact such a question, but not
necessarily in any properly mental, social, or moral
sense.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let us look at the matter a moment with reference
to various possible meanings of the words altruism
and altruistic. Taking the latter word as the most
convenient for our purpose, I can think of three meanings,
any one of which would answer well enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the vague current usage of it: first, that which is
suggested by another person, that is by his appearance,
words, or other symbols; second, that which
is for the benefit of another; third, good or moral.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the first sense, which carries no moral implication
at all, it is altruistic to give to the beggar, but
the word is also applicable to the greater part of our
actions, since most of them are suggested by others
in some way. And, of course, many of the actions
included are what are generally called selfish ones.
To strike a man with whom we are angry, to steal
from one of whom we are envious, to take liberties
with an attractive woman, and all sorts of reprehensible
proceedings suggested by the sight of another
person, would be altruistic in this sense, which I suppose,
therefore, cannot be the one intended by those
who use the word as the antithesis to egoistic.</p>

<p class='c012'>If we use the word in the second sense, that of
being for the benefit of another, to give to the beggar
may or may not be altruistic; thoughtful philanthropy
is inclined to say that it is usually for his harm. It
may, perhaps, be said that we at least intend to benefit
or please him, that this is the main thing, and
that it is a question whether the action has an I-reference
or a you-reference in the mind of the actor.
As to this I would again call attention to what was
said of the nature of I and you as personal ideas in
Chapter III., and of the nature of egotism in Chapter
VI. Our impulses regarding persons cannot, in my
opinion, be classified in this way. What could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>more selfish than the action of a mother who cannot
refuse her child indigestible sweetmeats? She gives
them both to please the child and to gratify a shallow
self which is identified with him. To refuse the
money to the beggar may be as altruistic, in the sense
of springing from the desire to benefit others, as to
give it. The self for which one wishes to keep the
dollar is doubtless a social self of some sort, and
very possibly has better social claims upon him than
the beggar: he may wish to buy flowers for a sick
child.</p>

<p class='c012'>I need hardly add that to give the money is not
necessarily the moral course. The attempt to identify
the good with what refers to others as against
what refers to one’s self is hopelessly confusing
and false, both theoretically and in practical application.</p>

<p class='c012'>In short it is hard to discover, in the word altruism,
any definite moral significance.</p>

<p class='c012'>The individual and the group are related in respect
to moral thought quite as they are everywhere else;
individual consciences and the social conscience are
not separate things, but aspects of one thing, namely,
the moral Life, which may be regarded as individual
by fixing our attention upon a particular conscience
in artificial isolation, or as general, by attending to
some collective phase, like public opinion upon a
moral question. Suppose, for instance, one were a
member of the Congress that voted the measure
which brought on the war with Spain. The question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>how he should vote on this measure would be, in its
individual aspect, a matter of private conscience; and
so with all other members. But taking the vote as a
whole, as a synthesis, showing the moral drift of the
group, it appears as an expression of a social conscience.
The separation is purely artificial, every
judgment of an individual conscience being social in
that it involves a synthesis of social influences, and
every social conscience being a collective view of individual
consciences. The concrete thing, the moral
Life, is a whole made up of differentiated members.
If this is at all hard to grasp, it is only because the
fact is a large one. We certainly cannot get far unless
we can learn to <em>see</em> organization, since all our
facts present it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The idea that the right is the social as opposed to
the sensual is, it seems to me, a sound one, if we
mean by it that the mentally higher, more personal
or imaginative impulses have on the whole far more
weight in conscience than the more sensual. The
immediate reason for this seems to be that the mind
of one who shares the higher life is so thronged with
vivid personal or social sentiments, that the merely
sensual cannot be the rational except where it is allied
with these, or at any rate not opposed to them.
It is for the psychologist to explain the mental processes
involved, but apparently the social interests
prevail in conscience over the sensual because they
are the major force; that is, they are, on the whole, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>much more numerous, vivid, and persistent, that they
determine the general system of thought, of which
conscience is the fullest expression.</p>

<p class='c012'>We may, perhaps, represent the matter nearly
enough for our purpose by comparing the higher and
lower kinds of thought to the human race and the inferior
animals. The former is so much more powerful,
on the whole, though not always so individually, that
it determines, in all settled countries, the general organization
of life, erecting cities and railroads, clearing
forests, and the like, to suit itself, and with only
incidental regard to other animals. The latter are
preserved within the system only in so far as they are
useful, or at any rate not very troublesome, to mankind.
So all sensual impulses are judged by their
relation to a system of thought dominated by social
sentiment. The pleasures of eating, harmless in themselves,
begin to be judged wrong so soon as they are
indulged in such a way as to blunt the higher faculties,
or to violate justice, decency, or the like. A shipwrecked
man, it is felt, should rather perish of hunger
than kill and eat another man, because the latter
action violates the whole system of social thought.
And in like manner it is held that a soldier, or indeed
any man, should prefer honor and duty to life itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>The working of personal influence upon our judgments
of right is not different in kind from its working
upon other judgments: it simply introduces vivid
impulses, which affect the moral synthesis something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>in the way that picking up a weight will change one’s
centre of gravity and force him to alter his footing.</p>

<p class='c012'>As was suggested above, the morality of mere rule
and habit becomes the less conspicuous in the life of
children the more they are subjected to fresh personal
influences. If their sympathies are somewhat
dull, or if they are secluded, their minds naturally
become grooved; and all children, perhaps, become
much bound to habit in matters where personal influence
is not likely to interfere. But in most children,
and in most matters, it will be found that the
moral judgment and feeling are, from the very earliest,
intensely sympathetic and personal, charged with
shame, affection, anger, jealousy, and desire to please.
The mind has already to struggle for harmony among
vivid emotions, aroused by the appeals of life to
hereditary instinct, each giving intensity to certain
ideas of conduct, and tending to sway the judgment
of right in their sense.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the boy who refused the candy, as mentioned
above, had possessed a vivid imagination of personal
attitudes, which he did not, his situation might have
been much more intricate. He might have been drawn
to accept it not only by the sweet taste but by a desire
to please the friends who offered it; and on the
other hand he might have been deterred by a vision
of the reproving face and voice of his mother. Thus
M., nearly sixteen months old, had been frowned at
and called naughty in a severe tone of voice when
she tried to claw her brother’s face. Shortly after,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>while sitting with him on the bed, her mother being
at a distance, she was observed to repeat the offence
and then, without further cause or suggestion, to bow
her head and look abashed and guilty. Apparently
she had a sense of wrong, a conviction of sin, perhaps
consisting only in a reminiscence of the shame
she had previously felt when similar behavior was followed
by rebuke.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here, then, we have a simple manifestation of a
moral force that acts upon every one of us in countless
ways, and every day of his life—the imagined
approval or disapproval of others, appealing to instinctive
emotion, and giving the force of that emotion
to certain views of conduct. The behavior that connects
itself with such social sentiment as we like and
feel the impulse to continue, is so much the more
likely to be judged as right; but if the sentiment is
one from which we are averse, the behavior is the
more likely to be judged as wrong. The child’s moral
sense, says Perez, “begins as soon as he understands
the signification of certain intonations of the voice,
of certain attitudes, of a certain expression of countenance,
intended to reprimand him for what he has
done or to warn him against something he was on
the point of doing. This penal and remunerative
sanction gives rise by degrees to a clear distinction of
concrete good and evil.”<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c013'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>A child who is not sensitive to praise or blame, but
whose interests are chiefly impersonal, or at any rate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>only indirectly personal, sometimes appears to have
no moral sense at all, to be without the conviction of
sin or any notion of <em>personal</em> wrong. He has little
experience of those peculiarly acute and trying mental
crises which result from the conflict of impulses of
sympathetic origin with one another or with animal
appetites. This was much the case with R. in his
earliest years. Living in quiet surroundings, somewhat
isolated from other children, with no violent or
particularly mischievous impulses, occupied all day
long with blocks, sand-pile, and other impersonal
interests, not sensitive to blame nor inclined to take it
seriously, he gave the impression of being non-moral,
an unfallen spirit. M. was the very opposite of all
this. From the first week she was visibly impulsive,
contentious, sensitive, sympathetic; laying traps for
approval, rebelling against criticism, sudden and
quick to anger, sinning, repenting, rejoicing; living
almost altogether in a vivid personal world.</p>

<p class='c012'>A character of the latter sort has an intenser moral
life, because the variety of strong impulses introduced
by a sensitive and personally imaginative temperament
are sure to make crises for the mind to wrestle
with. The ethics of personal feeling which it has to
work out seems widely apart from the ethics of rule
and habit, as in fact it is, so far as regards the materials
that enter into the moral synthesis. The color
and content, all the concrete elements of the moral
life, are as different as are the different characters of
people: the idea of right is not a fraction of thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>alike in all minds, but a comprehensive, integrating
state of mind, characteristic of the personality of
which it is an expression.</p>

<p class='c012'>The idea of justice is, of course, a phase of the idea
of right, and arises out of the mental attempt to reconcile
conflicting impulses. As Professor Baldwin
points out, the child is puzzled by contradictions
between his simpler impulses, such as those to appropriate
food and playthings, and other impulses of
more imaginative or sympathetic origin. Needing to
allay this conflict he readily grasps the notion of a
<em>tertium quid</em>, a reconciling rule or law which helps
him to do so.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our mature life is not radically distinguished from
childhood as regards the working of personal influence
upon our moral thought. If there is progress it is in
the way of fulness of experience and better organization:
the mental life may become richer in those
sympathetic or imaginative impulses which we derive
from healthy intercourse with the world, and without
a good store of which our judgments of right must be
narrow and distorted; there may at the same time
be a completer ordering and discipline of these materials,
a greater power to construct the right, the
unifying thought, out of diverse elements, a quicker
recognition of it when achieved, and a steadier disposition
to act upon it. In most cases, perhaps,
a person after thirty years of age gains something
in the promptness and steadfastness of his moral
judgment, and loses something in the imaginative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>breadth of his premises. But the process remains
the same, and our view of right is still a sort of microcosm
of our whole character. Whatever characteristic
passions we have will in some way be represented in
it, and until we stiffen into mental rigidity and decline,
it will change more or less with every important
change in our social surroundings.</p>

<p class='c011'>To a very large class of minds, perhaps to the
largest class, the notion of right presents itself chiefly
as a matter of personal authority. That is, what we
feel we ought to do is simply what we imagine our
guide or master would do, or would wish us to do.
This, for instance, is the idea very largely inculcated
and practised by the Christian Church. It is not
anything opposed to or different from the right as a
mental synthesis, but simply means that admiration,
reverence, or some other strong sentiment, gives such
overwhelming force to the suggestions of a certain
example, that they more or less completely dominate
the mind. The authority works through conscience
and not outside of it. Moreover the relation is not
so one-sided as it would seem, since our guide is always,
in one point of view, the creation of our own
imaginations, which are sure to interpret him in a
manner congenial to our native tendency. Thus the
Christ of Fra Angelico is one thing, and the Christ
of Michelangelo, directing the ruin of the damned,
is quite another.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ascendency of personal authority is usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>greater in proportion as the mind is of a simple,
visually imaginative, rather than reflective turn. People
of the sort commonly called “emotional,” with
ready and vivid personal feeling but little constructive
power, are likely to yield to an ascendent influence
as a whole, with little selection or reconstruction.
Their individuality is expressed chiefly in the
choice of a master; having chosen, they are all his.
If they change masters they change morals at the
same time. The mental unity of which they, like all
the rest of us, are in search, is found in allegiance to
a concrete personality, which saves them the impossible
task of abstract thought. Such people, however,
usually feel an attraction toward stability in others,
and secure it for themselves by selecting a steadfast
personality to anchor their imaginations to.</p>

<p class='c012'>This, of course, is possible or congenial only to
those who lack the mental vigor to make in a more
intellectual manner that synthesis of which moral
judgment is the expression. Those who have this
vigor make use of many examples, and if they acknowledge
the pre-eminence of anyone, he is likely
to be vaguely conceived and to be in reality no more
than the symbol of their own moral conclusions.</p>

<p class='c012'>The immediate power of personal images or influences
over our sense of right is probably greater in
all of us than we realize. “It is wonderful,” says
George Eliot in “Middlemarch,” “how much uglier
things will look when we only think we are blamed
for them&#160;... and, on the other hand, it is astonishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>how pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments
on those who never complain, or have nobody
to complain for them.” That is to say, other persons,
by awaking social self-feeling in us, give life
and power to certain sentiments of approval or disapproval
regarding our own actions. The rule, already
suggested, that the self of a sensitive person,
in the presence of an ascendent personality, tends to
become his interpretation of what the other thinks of
him, is a prime factor in determining the moral judgments
of all of us. Everyone must have felt the
moral renewal that comes with the mere presence of
one who is vigorously good, whose being enlivens our
aspiration and shames our backsliding, who makes us
really feel the desirability of the higher life and the
baseness and dulness of the lower.</p>

<p class='c012'>In one of Mr. Theodore Child’s papers on French
art he relates that Dagnan said after the death of
Bastien-Lepage, “With every new picture I paint in
future I shall try to think if he would have been
satisfied with it.” Almost the same has been said
by an American author with reference to Robert
Louis Stevenson. And these instances are typical
of the general fact that our higher selves, our distinctively
right views and choices, are dependent
upon imaginative realization of the points of view of
other persons. There is, I think, no possibility of
being good without living, imaginatively of course,
in good company; and those who uphold the moral
power of personal example, as against that of abstract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>thought are certainly in the right. A mental
crisis, by its very difficulty, is likely to call up the
thought of some person we have been used to look
to as a guide, and the confronting of the two ideas,
that of the person and that of the problem, compels
us to answer the question What would he have
thought of it? The guide we appeal to may be a
person in the room, or a distant friend, or an author
whom we have never seen, or an ideal person of
religion. The strong, good men we have once
imagined live in our minds and fortify there the idea
of worthiness. They were free and noble and make
us unhappy to be less.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course the influence of other persons often goes
by contraries. The thought of one who is repugnant
to us often brings a strong sense of the wrong
of that for which he stands, and our conviction of
the hatefulness of any ill trait is much enlivened by
intimate contact with one who exhibits it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The moral potency of confession, and of all sorts
of publicity, rests upon the same basis. In opening
ourselves to another we are impelled to imagine how
our conduct appears to him; we take an outside
view of ourselves. It makes a great difference to
whom we confess: the higher the character of the
person whose mind we imagine, the more enlightening
and elevating is the view of ourselves that we
get. Even to write our thoughts in a diary, and so
to confess, not to a particular person, but to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>vague image of an interlocutor that connects itself
with all articulate expression, makes things look
different.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is, perhaps, much the same with prayer. To
pray, in a higher sense, is to confront our moral
perplexities with the highest personal ideal we can
form, and so to be unconsciously integrating the two,
straightening out the one in accordance with the
other. It would seem that social psychology strongly
corroborates the idea that prayer is an essential
aspect of the higher life; by showing, I mean, that
thought, and especially vivid thought, is interlocutory
in its very nature, and that aspiration almost necessarily
takes, more or less distinctly, the form of intercourse
with an ideal being.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whatever publishes our conduct introduces new
and strong factors into conscience; but whether this
publicity is wholesome or otherwise depends upon
the character of the public; or, more definitely, upon
whether the idea of ourselves that we impute to this
public is edifying or degrading. In many cases, for
instance, it is ruinous to a person’s character to be
publicly disgraced, because he, or she, presently accepts
the degrading self that seems to exist in the
minds of others. There are some people to whom
we should be ashamed to confess our sins, and others,
perhaps, to whom we should not like to own our
virtues. Certainly it should not be assumed that it
is good for us to have our acts displayed before the
generality of persons: while this may be a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>thing as regards matters, like the tax-roll, that relate
to our obvious duty to the immediate community, it
has in most things a somewhat vulgarizing effect,
tending to promote conformity rather than a distinctive
life. If the scholar’s study were on the market-place,
so that the industrious townspeople could
see how many hours of the day he spends in apparent
idleness, he might lack courage to pursue his vocation.
In short, we need privacy as against influences that
are not edifying, and communion with those that are.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even telling the truth does not result so much
from a need of mental accuracy, though this is strong
in some minds, as from a sense of the unfairness of
deceiving people of our own sort, and of the shame
of being detected in so doing. Consequently the
maxim, “Truth for friends and lies for enemies,” is
very generally followed, not only by savages and
children, but, more or less openly, by civilized people.
Most persons feel reluctant to tell a lie in so
many words, but few have any compunctions in deceiving
by manner, and the like, persons toward
whom they feel no obligation. We all know business
men who will boast of their success in deceiving
rivals; and probably few of us hold ourselves to
quite the same standard of honor in dealing with one
we believe to be tricky and ill-disposed toward us,
that we would if we thought him honest and well
meaning. “Conscience is born of love” in this as
in many matters. A thoughtful observer will easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>see that injustice and not untruth is the essence of
lying, as popularly conceived.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is because of our need to recall vanished persons,
that all goodness and justice, all right of any
large sort, depend upon an active imagination.
Without it we are the prisoners of the immediate
environment and of the suggestions of the lower organism.
It is only this that enables us to live with
the best our lives have afforded, and maintain higher
suggestions to compete with the baser ones that assail
us. Let us hear Professor James again: “When
for motives of honor and conscience I brave the condemnation
of my own family, club and ‘set’; when
as a Protestant I turn Catholic; as a Catholic, free-thinker;
as a ‘regular practitioner,’ homeopath, or
what not, I am always inwardly strengthened in my
course, and steeled against the loss of my actual
social self by the thought of other and better <em>possible</em>
social judges than those whose verdict goes against
me now. The ideal social self which I thus seek in
appealing to their decision may be very remote; it
may be represented as barely possible. I may not
hope for its realization during my lifetime; I may
even expect the future generations, which would approve
me if they knew me, to know nothing about
me when I am dead and gone.”<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c013'><sup>[100]</sup></a> As regards the
nearness or remoteness of the companion it would
perhaps be sufficient to say that if imagined he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>actually present, so far as our mental and moral life
are concerned, and except as affecting the vividness
of our idea of him, it makes no immediate difference
whether we ever saw him or whether he ever had any
corporeal existence at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>The alteration of conscience due to the advent in
thought of a new person is often so marked that one
view of duty is quite evidently supplanted by a fresh
one, due to the fresh suggestion. Thus, to take an
example probably familiar to all who are used to
mental application, it sometimes happens that a
student is fagged and yet feels that he must think
out his problem; there is a strong sense of oughtness
backing this view, which, so long as it is unopposed,
holds its ground as the call of duty. But now a
friend may come in and suggest to him that he ought
to stop, that if he goes on he will harm himself and
do poor work. Here is another view of right, and
the mind must now make a fresh synthesis and come,
perhaps, to feel that its duty is to leave off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Because of its dependence upon personal suggestion,
the right always reflects a social group; there
is always a circle of persons, more or less extended,
whom we really imagine, and who thus work upon
our impulses and our conscience; while people outside
of this have not a truly personal existence for
us. The extent of this circle depends upon many
circumstances, as for instance upon the vigor of our
imaginations, and the reach of the means of communication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>through which personal symbols are impressed
upon them.</p>

<p class='c012'>In these days of general literacy, many get their
most potent impressions from books, and some, finding
this sort of society more select and stimulating
than any other, cultivate it to the neglect of palpable
persons. This kind of people often have a very tender
conscience regarding the moral problems presented
in novels, but a rather dull one for those of
the flesh-and-blood life about them. In fact, a large
part of the sentiments of imaginative persons are
purely literary, created and nourished by intercourse
with books, and only indirectly connected with what
is commonly called experience. Nor should it be assumed
that these literary sentiments are necessarily
a mere dissipation. Our highest ideals of life come
to us largely in this way, since they depend upon
imaginative converse with people we do not have a
chance to know in the flesh. Indeed, the expansion
of conscience that is so conspicuous a fact of recent
years, the rise of moral sentiment regarding international
relations, alien races and social and industrial
classes other than our own, could not have taken
place without the aid of cheap printing and rapid
communication. Such understanding and sense of
obligation as we have regarding the populace of
great cities, for instance, is due chiefly to writers who,
like the author of “How the Other Half Lives,” describe
the life of such people in a vivid, personal way,
and so cause us to imagine it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Not to pursue this line of thought too far, it is
enough for our purpose to note that conscience is
always a group conscience, however the group may
be formed, so that our moral sentiment always reflects
our time, our country, and our special field of personal
imagination. On the other hand, our sense of
right ignores those whom we do not, through sympathy,
feel as part of ourselves, no matter how close
their physical contiguity. To the Norman conqueror
the Saxon was an inferior animal, whose sentiments
he no more admitted to his imagination, I suppose,
than a farmer does those of his cattle, and toward
whom, accordingly, he did not feel human obligation.
It was the same with the slaveholder and the slave,
and so it sometimes is with employer and wage-earner.
The behavior of the Europeans toward the
Chinese during the recent invasion of China showed
in a striking manner how completely moral obligation
breaks down in dealing with people who are not felt
to be of kindred humanity with ourselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>In minds capable of constructive imagination the
social factor in conscience may take the form of ideal
persons, whose traits are used as a standard of behavior.</p>

<p class='c012'>Idealization, of this or any other sort, is not to
be thought of as sharply marked off from experience
and memory. It seems probable that the mind is
never indifferent to the elements presented to it, but
that its very nature is to select, arrange, harmonize,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>idealize. That is, the whole is always acting upon
the parts, tending to make them one with itself.
What we call distinctively an ideal is only a relatively
complex and finished product of this activity. The
past, as it lives in our minds, is never a mere repetition
of old experience, but is always colored by our
present feeling, is always idealized in some sense;
and it is the same with our anticipation of the future,
so that to wholesome thought expectation is hope.
Thus the mind is ever an artist, re-creating things
in a manner congenial to itself, and special arts are
only a more deliberate expression of a general tendency.</p>

<p class='c012'>An ideal, then, is a somewhat definite and felicitous
product of imagination, a harmonious and congenial
reconstruction of the elements of experience. And a
personal ideal is such a harmonious and congenial reconstruction
of our experience of persons. Its active
function is to symbolize and define the desirable, and
by so doing to make it the object of definite endeavor.
The ideal of goodness is only the next step beyond
the good man of experience, and performs the same
energizing office. Indeed, as I have already pointed
out, there is no separation between actual and ideal
persons, only a more or less definite connection of
personal ideas with material bodies.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are all degrees of vagueness or definition in
our personal ideals. They may be no more than
scattered imaginings of traits which we have met in
experience and felt to be worthy; or they may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>assume such fulness and cohesion as to be distinct
ideal persons. There may even be several personal
ideals; one may cherish one ideal of himself and a
different one for each of his intimate friends; or his
imagination may project several ideals of himself, to
correspond to various phases of his development.</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably the phrase “ideal person” suggests
something more unified and consistent than is actually
present in the minds of most people when they conceive
the desirable or good in personal character. Is
it not rather ideal traits or sentiments, fragments of
personal experience, phases of past intercourse returning
in the imagination with a new emphasis in
the presence of new situations? We have at times
divined in other people courage, generosity, patience
and justice, and judged them to be good. Now, when
we find ourselves in a situation where these traits are
called for, we are likely to be reminded by that very
fact of our previous experience of them; and the
memory of it brings these sentiments more vividly
to life and gives them more authority in conscience.
Thus a person hesitating whether to smuggle in dutiable
goods is likely to think in his perplexity of some
one whom he has come to regard as honorable in
such matters, and of how that one would feel and act
under like conditions.</p>

<p class='c012'>This building up of higher personal conceptions
does not lend itself to precise description. It is
mostly subconscious; the mind is continually at work
ordering and bettering its past and present experiences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>working them up in accordance with its own
instinctive need for consistency and pleasantness;
ever idealizing, but rarely producing clean-cut ideals.
It finds its materials both in immediate personal intercourse
and through books and other durable media
of expression. “Books, monuments, pictures, conversation,
are portraits in which he finds the lineaments
he is forming.” “All that is said of the wise
man&#160;... describes to each reader his own idea,
describes his unattained but attainable self.”<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c013'><sup>[101]</sup></a> “A
few anecdotes, a few traits of character, manners,
face, a few incidents, have an emphasis in your memory
out of all proportion to their apparent significance,
if you measure them by the ordinary standards.
They relate to your gift. Let them have their weight,
and do not reject them and cast about for illustrations
more usual in literature. What your heart
thinks great is great. The soul’s emphasis is always
right.”<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c013'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Idealism in this vague form has neither first, second,
nor third person. It is simply an impression of the
desirable in personality, and is impulsively applied
to your conduct, my conduct, or his conduct, as the
case may be. The sentiment occurs to us, and the connection
in which it occurs determines its moral application.
We sometimes speak as if it required an unusual
effort of virtue to apply the same standards to
ourselves as to others; and so it does, in one sense;
but in another it is easier and more common to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>this than not to do it. The simplest thing, as regards
the mental process concerned, is to take ideas of conduct
as they come, without thinking specially where
they come from, and judge them by the standard that
conscience presents to us. Injustice and personal
wrong of all sorts, as between one’s self and others,
commonly consist, not in imagining the other man’s
point of view and refusing to give it weight; but in
not imagining it, not admitting him to the tribunal at
all. It is in exerting the imagination that the effort
of virtue comes in. One who entertains the thought
and feeling of others can hardly refuse them justice;
he has made them a part of himself. There is, as we
have seen, no first or second person about a sentiment;
if it is alive in the mind that is all there is to
the matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is perhaps the case, however, that almost every
person of imagination has at times a special and
somewhat definite ideal self, concerning which he has
the “my” feeling, and which he would not use in
judging others. It is, like all ideals, a product of
constructive imagination working upon experience.
It represents what we should like to see ourselves,
and has an especially vigorous and varied life in early
youth, when the imagination projects models to match
each new aspiration that gains power over it. In a
study of the “Continued Stories” of children, by
Mabel W. Learoyd, many interesting facts are given
illustrating sustained self-idealization. These continued
stories are somewhat consecutive series of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>imaginations on the part of the young, recalled and
described at a later period. Two-thirds are said to
embody an ideal, and the author, in an idealized
form, is the hero of many of them.<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c013'><sup>[103]</sup></a> An instance of
this same process continued into old age is the fact
mentioned by Mr. E. W. Emerson in his “Emerson
in Concord,”<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c013'><sup>[104]</sup></a> that the poet’s diary contains frequent
allusion to one Osman, who stands for an ideal
self, a more perfect Emerson of his aspiration.</p>

<p class='c012'>It would always be found, I think, that our ideal
self is constructed chiefly out of ideas about us
attributed to other people. We can hardly get any
distinct view of ourselves except in this way, that is
by placing ourselves at the standpoint of someone
else. The impressions thus gained are worked over
and over, like other mental material, and, according
to the imaginative vigor of the mind, more or less reorganized,
and projected as an ideal.</p>

<p class='c012'>With some this ideal is quite definite and visible
before the eye of the mind. I have heard the expression
“seeing yourself” applied to it. Thus one woman
says of another “She always sees herself in evening
dress,” meaning that her ideal of herself is one of
social propriety or distinction, and that it takes the
form of an image of her visible person as it appears
to others in a shape expressing these traits. This is,
of course, a phase of the reflected self, discussed in
the fifth chapter. Some people “see themselves” so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>constantly, and strive so obviously to live up to the
image, that they give a curious impression of always
acting a part, as if one should compose a drama with
himself as chief personage, and then spend his life
playing it. Perhaps something of this sort is inevitable
with persons of vivid imagination.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once formed and familiarized the ideal self serves,
like any ideal only more directly, as an incitement to
growth in its direction, and a punishment to retrogression.
A man who has become used to imagining
himself as noble, beneficent and respected has a real
picture in his mind, a fair product of aspiring
thought, a work of art. If his conduct violates this
imagination he has a sense of ugliness and shame;
there is a rent in the picture, a rude, shapeless hole,
shattering its beauty, and calling for painful and
tedious repairs before it can be even tolerable to
look upon. Repentance is the pain of this spectacle;
and the clearer and more firmly conceived the ideal,
the greater the pain.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ideal person or persons of an ethical religion
are the highest expression of this creative outreaching
of the mind after the admirable in personality.
It can hardly be supposed, by anyone who is willing
to go into the psychology of the matter at all, that
they are radically different from other ideal persons,
or in any way sharply divided from the mass of personal
thought. Any comparative study of idealism,
among nations in various stages of civilization, among
persons of different intellectual power, among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>various periods of development in one individual, can
hardly fail, I should say, to leave a conviction that
all hangs together, that there is no chasm anywhere,
that the most rudimentary idealizing impulse of the
savage or the child is of a piece with the highest
religious conceptions. The tendency of such a view,
of course, is not to drag down the exalted, but to
show all as part of a common life.</p>

<p class='c012'>All ideals of personality are derived from intercourse,
and all that attain any general acceptance
have a social organization and history. Each historical
epoch or nation has its somewhat distinctive personal
ideals, which are instilled into the individual
from the general store of thought. It is especially
true that the persons of religion have this character.
They are communal and cumulative, are gradually
built up and become in some degree an institution.
In this way they may acquire richness, clearness,
sanctity, and authority, and may finally be inculcated
as something above and outside of the human mind.
The latter is certain to happen if they are made the
basis of a discipline to be applied to all sorts of
people. The dogma that they are extra-human serves,
like the forms and ceremonies of a court, to secure to
them the prestige of distance and inaccessibility.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a chief function of religious organization to
make the moral synthesis more readily attainable, by
establishing a spiritual discipline, or system of influences
and principles, which shall constantly stimulate
one’s higher sentiments, and furnish a sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>outline or scaffolding of suggestions to aid him in
organizing his thought. In doing this its main agent
is the inculcation of personal ideals, although the
teaching of creeds is also, perhaps, important to the
same purpose. It is apparently part of the legitimate
function of organized moral thought to enter the
vaguer fields of speculation about conduct and inculcate
provisional ideas, relating for instance to the
origin and meaning of life—matters which the mind
must and will explore, with or without a guide. To
have suggested to them definite ways of thinking regarding
such matters helps to make mental unity possible,
and to save men from the aimless and distracting
wanderings that often end in despair. Of course
these ideas must be in harmony with the general state
of thought, consistent, for example, with the established
results of science. Otherwise they only increase
the distraction. But a <em>credible creed</em> is an
excellent thing, and the lack of it is a real moral
deficiency.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now in times of intellectual unsettlement, like the
present, the ideal may become disorganized and scattered,
the face of God blurred to the view, like the
reflection of the sun in troubled waters. And at the
same time the creeds become incredible, so that, until
new ones can be worked out and diffused, each man
must either make one for himself—a task to which
few are equal—or undergo distraction, or cease to
think about such matters, if he can. This state of
things involves some measure of demoralization, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>it may be part of a movement generally beneficent.
Mankind needs the highest vision of personality,
and needs it clear and vivid, and in the lack
of it will suffer a lack in the clearness and cogency of
moral thought. It is the natural apex to the pyramid
of personal imagination, and when it is wanting
there will be an unremitting and eventually more or
less successful striving to replace it. When it reappears
it will, of course, express in all its lineaments
a new era of thought; but the opinion that it is gone
to stay, which is entertained by some, seems very
ill grounded.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Is a Phase of the Question of Right and Wrong—Relation
to the Idea of Development—Justification and Meaning of
the Phrase “Personal Degeneracy”—Hereditary and
Social Factors in Personal Degeneracy—Degeneracy as a
Mental Trait—Conscience in Degeneracy—Crime, Insanity,
and Responsibility—General Aims in the Treatment
of Degeneracy.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>I wish to touch upon this subject only in so far as
to suggest a general way of conceiving it in accord
with the views set forth in the preceding chapters.</p>

<p class='c012'>The question of personal degeneracy is a phase of
the question of right or wrong and is ultimately determined
by conscience. A degenerate might be defined
as one whose personality falls distinctly short
of a standard set by the dominant moral thought of a
group. It is the nature of the mind to form standards
of better or worse in all matters toward which
its selective activity is directed; and this has its collective
as well as its individual aspect, so that not
only every man but every group has its preferences
and aversions, its good and bad. The selective, organizing
processes which all life, and notably the
life of the mind, presents, involve this distinction; it
is simply a formulation of the universal fact of preference.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>We cannot view things in which we are interested
without liking some and disliking others; and
somewhat in proportion to our interest is our tendency
to express these likes and dislikes by good and
bad or similar words. And since there is nothing
that interests us so much as persons, judgments of
right and wrong regarding them have always been
felt and expressed with peculiar zest and emphasis.
The righteous and the wicked, the virtuous and the
vicious, the good and bad under a hundred names,
have been sharply and earnestly discriminated in
every age and country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although this distinction between personal good
and bad has always been a fact of human thought, a
broader view of it is reached, in these days, through
the idea of evolution. The method of nature being
everywhere selective, growth is seen to take place not
by making a like use of the elements already existing,
but by the fostering of some to the comparative neglect
or suppression of others. Or, if this statement
gives too much the idea of a presiding intelligence
outside the process itself, we may simply say that
the functions of existing elements in contributing to
further growth are extremely different, so much so
that some of them usually appear to have no important
function at all, or even to impede the growth,
while others appear to be the very heart of the onward
or crescent life. This idea is applicable to
physiological processes, such as go on within our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>bodies, to the development of species, as illustrated
with such convincing detail by Darwin, and to all
the processes of thought and of society; so that the
forces that are observed in the present, if viewed with
reference to function or tendency, never appear to be
on the same level of value, but are strung along at
different levels, some below a mean, some above it.
Thus we not only have the actual discrimination of
good and bad in persons, but a philosophy which
shows it as an incident of evolution, a reflection in
thought of the general movement of nature.</p>

<p class='c012'>Or, to regard the process of evolution in more detail,
we find degeneracy or inferiority implied in that
idea of variation which is the starting-point of Darwinism.
All forms of life, it seems, exhibit variation;
that is, the individuals are not quite alike
but differ from one another and from the parents
in a somewhat random manner, so that some are
better adapted to the actual conditions of life, and
some worse. The change or development of a species
takes place by the cumulative survival and multiplication,
generation after generation, of fit or fortunate
variations. The very process that produces the fittest
evidently implies the existence of the unfit; and
the distinctly unfit individuals of any species may
be regarded as the degenerate.</p>

<p class='c012'>It will not do to transfer these ideas too crudely to
the mental and social life of mankind; but it will
hardly be disputed that the character of persons exhibits
variations which are partly at least incalculable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>and which produce on the one hand leadership and
genius and on the other weakness and degeneracy.
We probably cannot have the one without having
something, at least, of the other, though I believe
that the variations of personality are capable, to a
great degree, of being brought under rational control.</p>

<p class='c011'>This truth that all forms of deficient humanity
have a common philosophical aspect is one reason
for giving them some common name, like degeneracy.
Another is that the detailed study of fact more and
more forces the conclusion that such things as crime,
pauperism, idiocy, insanity, and drunkenness have, in
great measure, a common causation, and so form,
practically, parts of a whole. We see this in the study
of heredity, which shows that the transmitted taint
commonly manifests itself in several or all of these
forms in different generations or individuals of the
same family; and we see it in the study of social conditions,
in the fact that where these conditions are
bad, as in the slums of great cities, all the forms become
more prevalent. A third reason for the use of
a special term is that it is desirable that the matter
receive more dispassionate study than formerly, and
this may possibly be promoted by the use of words
free, so far as possible, from irrelevant implications.
Many of the words in common use, such as badness,
wickedness, crime and the like, reflect particular
views of the facts, such as the religious view of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>as righteousness or sin, and the legal view as criminal
or innocent, while degeneracy suggests the disinterestedness
of science.</p>

<p class='c012'>I do not much care to justify the particular word
degeneracy in this connection, further than to say
that I know of none more convenient or less objectionable.
It comes, of course, from <em>de</em> and <em>genus</em>
through <em>degenerare</em>, and seems to mean primarily the
state of having fallen from a type. It is not uncommon
in English literature, usually meaning inferiority
to the standard set by ancestors, as when we say a
degenerate age, a degenerate son, etc.; and recently
it has come into use to describe any kind of marked
and enduring mental defect or inferiority. I see no
objection to this usage unless it be that it is doubtful
whether the mentally or morally inferior person can
in all cases be said <em>to have fallen</em> from a higher state.
This might be plausibly argued on both sides, but it
does not seem worth while.</p>

<p class='c012'>I use the phrase personal degeneracy, then, to describe
the state of persons whose character and conduct
fall distinctly below the type or standard regarded
as normal by the dominant sentiment of the
group. Although it must be admitted that this definition
is a vague one, it is not more so, perhaps, than
most definitions of mental or social phenomena.
There is no sharp criterion of what is mentally and
socially up to par and what is not, but there are
large and important classes whose inferiority is evident,
such as idiots, imbeciles, the insane, drunkards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>and criminals; and no one will question the
importance of studying the whole of which these are
parts.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is altogether a social matter at bottom; that is
to say, degeneracy exists only in a certain relation
between a person and the rest of a group. In so far
as any mental or physical traits constitute it they do
so because they involve unfitness for a normal social
career, in which alone the essence of the matter is
found. The only palpable test of it—and this an
uncertain one—is found in the actual career of the
person, and especially in the attitude toward him of
the organized thought of the group. We agree fairly
well upon the degeneracy of the criminal, largely
because his abnormality is of so obvious and troublesome
a kind that something in particular has to be
done about it, and so he becomes definitely and formally
stigmatized by the organs of social judgment.
Yet even from this decisive verdict an appeal is
successfully made in some cases to the wider and
maturer thought of mankind, so that many have been
executed as felons who, like John Brown, are now
revered as heroes.</p>

<p class='c012'>In short, the idea of wrong, of which the idea of
degeneracy is a phase, partakes of the same uncertainty
that belongs to its antithesis, the idea of right.
Both are expressions of an ever-developing, always
selective life, and share in the indeterminateness that
necessarily goes with growth. They assume forms
definite enough for the performance of their momentous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>practical functions, but always remain essentially
plastic and variable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Concerning the causation of degeneracy, we may
say, as of every aspect of personality, that its roots
are to be looked for somewhere in the mingling of
hereditary and social factors from which the individual
life springs. Both of these factors exhibit marked
variation; men differ in their natural traits very much
as other animals do, and they also find themselves
subject to the varying influences of a diversified social
order. The actual divergences of character and conduct
which they exhibit are due to the composition of
these two variables into a third variable, the man
himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>In some cases the hereditary factor is so clearly deficient
as to make it natural and justifiable to regard
heredity as the cause; in a much larger number of
cases there is good reason to think that social conditions
are more particularly to blame, and that
the original hereditary outfit was fairly good. In a
third class, the largest, perhaps, of all, it is practically
impossible to discriminate between them. Indeed,
it is always a loose way of speaking to set heredity
and environment over against each other as separable
forces, or to say that either one is the cause of character
or of any personal trait. They have no separate
existence after personal development is under
way; each reacts upon the other, and every trait is
due to their intimate union and co-operation. All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>we are justified in saying is that one or the other
may be so aberrant as to demand our special attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>Congenital idiocy is regarded as hereditary degeneracy,
because it is obvious that no social environment
can make the individual other than deficient,
and we must work upon heredity if we wish to prevent
it. On the other hand, when we find that certain conditions,
like residence in crowded parts of a city, are
accompanied by the appearance of a large per cent. of
criminality, among a population whom there is no
reason to suppose naturally deficient, we are justified
in saying that the causes of this degeneracy are social
rather than hereditary. The fact probably is, in the
latter case, that the criminality is due to the conjunction
of degrading surroundings with a degree
of hereditary deficiency that a better training would
have rendered harmless, or at least inconspicuous;
but, practically, if we wish to diminish this sort of
degeneracy, we must work upon social conditions.</p>

<p class='c012'>A sound mental heredity consists essentially in
teachability, a capacity to learn the things required
by the social order; and the congenital idiot is degenerate
by the hereditary factor alone, because he
is incapable of learning these things. But a sound
heredity is no safeguard against personal degeneracy;
if we have teachability all turns upon what is
taught, and this depends upon the social environment.
The very faculties that lead a child to become
good or moral in a good environment may cause him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>to become criminal in a criminal environment; it is
all a question of what he finds to learn. It may be said,
then, that of the four possible combinations between
good and bad heredity and good and bad environment,
three—bad heredity with bad or good environment,
and good heredity with bad environment—lead
to degeneracy. Only when both elements are favorable
can we have a good result. Of course, by bad
environment in this connection must be understood
bad in its action upon this particular individual, not
as judged by some other standard.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the social surroundings of a person can be
changed, and his hereditary bias cannot, it is expedient,
in that vast majority of cases in which causation
is obscure, to assume as a working hypothesis
that the social factor is at fault, and to try by altering
it to alter the person. This is more and more coming
to be done in all intelligent treatment of degeneracy.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a mental trait, marking a person off as, in some
sense, worse than others in the same social group,
degeneracy appears to consist in some lack in the
higher organization of thought. It is not that one
has the normal mental outfit plus something additional,
called wrong, crime, sin, madness, or the like,
but that he is in some way deficient in the mental
activity by which sympathy is created and by which
all impulses are unified with reference to a general
life. The criminal impulses, rage, fear, lust, pride,
vanity, covetousness, and so on, are the same in general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>type as those of the normal person; the main
difference is that the criminal lacks, in one way or
another, the higher mental organization—a phase of
the social organization—to which these impulses
should be subordinate. It would not be very difficult
to take the seven deadly sins—Pride, Envy,
Anger, Sloth, Covetousness, Gluttony, and Lust—and
show that each may be regarded as the undisciplined
manifestation of a normal or functional tendency.
Indeed, as regards anger this was attempted in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To describe in detail the different varieties of
degeneracy that are met with,” says Dr. Maudsley,
“would be an endless and barren labor. It would
be as tedious as to attempt to describe particularly
the exact character of the ruins of each house in a
city that had been destroyed by an earthquake: in
one place a great part of the house may be left standing,
in another place a wall or two, and in another
the ruin is so great that scarcely one stone is left
upon another.”<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c013'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>In the lowest phases mental organization can
hardly be said to exist at all: an idiot has no character,
no consistent or effective individuality. There is
no unification, and so no self-control or stable will;
action simply reflects the particular animal impulse
that is ascendent. Hunger, sexual lust, rage, dread,
and, in somewhat higher grades, a crude, naïve kindliness,
are each felt and expressed in the simplest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>manner possible. There can, of course, be little or
no true sympathy, and the unconsciousness of what
is going on in the minds of other persons prevents
any sense of decency or attempt to conform to social
standards.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the higher grades we may make the distinction,
already suggested in speaking of egotism, between
the unstable and the rigid varieties. Indeed, as was
intimated, selfishness and degeneracy are of the
same general character; both being defined socially
by a falling short of accepted standards of conduct,
and mentally by some lack in the scope and organization
of the mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is, then, one sort of persons in whom the
most conspicuous and troublesome trait is mere mental
inconsistency and lack of character, and another
who possess a fair degree, at least, of consistency and
unity of purpose, but whose mental scope or reach of
sympathy is so small that they have no adequate relation
to the life about them.</p>

<p class='c012'>An outgrowing, impressionable sort of mind, if
deficient in the power to work up its material, is
necessarily unstable and lacking in momentum and
definite direction: and in the more marked cases we
have people of the hysterical type, unstable forms of
dementia and insanity, and impulsive crime. “The
fundamental defect in the hysterical brain,” says Dr.
Dana, “is that it is circumscribed in its associative
functions; the field of consciousness is limited just
as is the field of vision. The mental activity is confined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>to personal feelings, which are not regulated by
connotation of past experiences, hence they flow over
too easily into emotional outbursts or motor paroxysms.
The hysterical person cannot think.”<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c013'><sup>[106]</sup></a> It is
evident that something similar might be said of all
manifestations of instability.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, an ingrowing sort of mind,
whose tendency is rather to work over and over its
cherished thoughts than to open out to new ones,
may have a marked deficiency of sensibility and
breadth of perception. If so, the person is likely to
exhibit some form of gross and persistent egotism,
such as sensuality, avarice, narrow and ruthless ambition,
fanaticism, of a hard, cold sort, delusion of
greatness, or those kinds of crime that result from
habitual insensibility to social standards rather than
from transient impulse.</p>

<p class='c011'>As conscience is simply the completest product of
mental organization, it will of course share in whatever
defect there may be in the mental life as a
whole. In the lower grades of idiocy we may assume
that there is no system in the mind from which a
conscience could spring. In a higher degenerate of
the unstable type, there is a conscience, but it is vacillating
in its judgments, transient in duration and ineffectual
in control, proportionally to the mental disintegration
which it reflects. We all, probably, can
think of people conspicuously lacking in self-control,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>and it will perhaps be evident, when we reflect upon
them, that their consciences are of this sort. The
voice of conscience, with them, is certain to be chiefly
an echo of temporary emotions, because a synthesis
embracing long periods of time is beyond their
range; it is frequently inaudible, on account of their
being engrossed by passing impulses, and their conduct
is largely without any rational control at all.
They are likely to suffer sharp and frequent attacks
of remorse, on account of failure to live up to their
standards, but it would seem that the wounds do not
go very deep as a rule, but share in the general superficiality
of their lives. People of this sort, if not
too far gone in weakness, are probably the ones who
profit most by punishment, because they are helped
by the sharp and definite pain which it associates
with acts that they recognize as wrong, but cannot
keep from doing without a vivid emotional deterrent.
They are also the ones who, in their eagerness to escape
from the pains of fluctuation and inconsistency,
are most prone to submit blindly to some external
and dogmatic authority. Unable to rule themselves,
they crave a master, and if he only is a master, that
is, one capable of grasping and dominating the emotions
by which they are swayed, they will often cleave
to him and kiss the rod.</p>

<p class='c012'>With those whose defect is rigidity rather than instability,
conscience may exist and may control the
life; the trouble with it is, that it is not in key with
the consciences of other people. There is an original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>poverty of the impulses that extends to any result
that can be worked out of them. It may appear
startling to some to assert that conscience may dictate
the wrong, but such is quite clearly the fact, if
we identify the right with some standard of conduct
accepted among people of broad sympathies. Conscience
is the only possible moral guide—any external
authority can work morally upon us only through
conscience—but it always partakes of the limitations
of one’s character, and so far as that is degenerate
the idea of right is degenerate also. As a matter of
fact, the very worst men of the hard, narrow, fanatical,
or brutal sorts, often live at peace with their consciences.
I feel sure that anyone who reflects imaginatively
upon the characters of people he has known
of this sort will agree that such is the case. A bad
conscience implies mental division, inconsistency between
thought and deed, and men of this sort are
often quite at one with themselves. The usurer who
grinds the faces of the poor, the unscrupulous speculator
who causes the ruin of innocent investors to aggrandize
himself, the fanatical anarchist who stabs a
king or shoots a president, the Kentucky mountaineer
who regards murderous revenge as a duty, the
assaulter who causes pictures commemorative of his
crimes to be tattooed on his skin, are diverse examples
of wrong-doers whose consciences not only do not
punish, but often instigate their ill deeds.</p>

<p class='c012'>The idea, cherished by some, that crime or wrong
of any sort is invariably pursued by remorse, arises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>from the natural but mistaken assumption that all
other people have consciences similar to our own.
The man of sensitive temperament and refined habit
of thought feels that he would suffer remorse if he
had done the deed, and supposes that the same
must be the case with the perpetrator. On the
contrary, it seems likely that only a very small
proportion of those whom the higher moral sentiment
regards as wrong-doers suffer much from the
pricks of conscience. If the general tenor of a
man’s life is high, and the act is the fearful outcome
of a moment of passion, as is often the case
with unpremeditated murder, he will suffer, but if
his life is all of a piece, he will not. All authorities
agree that the mass of criminals, and the same is
clearly true of ill-doers within the law, have a habit
of mind of which the ill deed is the logical outcome,
so that there is nothing sudden or catastrophic about
it. Of course, if we apply the word conscience only
to the mental synthesis of a mind rich in higher sentiments,
then such people have no consciences, but it
seems a broader view of the matter to say that they
have a conscience, in so far as they have mental unity,
but that it reflects the general narrowness and perversion
of their lives. In fact, people of this description
usually, if not always, have standards of their own,
some sort of honor among thieves, which they will
not transgress, or which, if transgressed, cause remorse.
It is impossible that mental organization
should not produce a moral synthesis of some sort.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>There is nothing in this way of conceiving degeneracy
which tends to break down the practical distinctions
among the various forms of it, as, for instance,
that between crime and insanity. Though
the line between these two is arbitrary and uncertain,
as must always be the case in the classification of
mental facts, and as is confessed by the existence of
a class called the criminal insane, yet the distinction
itself and the difference in treatment associated with
it are sound enough in a general way.</p>

<p class='c012'>The contrast between our attitudes toward crime
and toward insanity is primarily a matter of personal
idea and impulse. We understand the criminal act,
or think we do, and we feel toward it resentment, or
hostile sympathy; while we do not understand the
insane act, and so do not resent it, but regard it with
pity, curiosity, or disgust. If one man strikes down
another to rob him, or in revenge, we can imagine the
offender’s state of mind, his motive lives in our
thought and is condemned by conscience precisely as
if we thought of doing the act ourselves. Indeed, to
understand an act <em>is</em> to think of doing it ourselves.
But, if it is done for no reason that we can comprehend,
we do not imagine, do not get a personal impression
of the case at all, but have to think of it as
merely mechanical. It is the same sort of difference
as that between a person who injures us accidentally
and one who does it “on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Secondarily, it is a matter of expediency. We feel
that the act which we can imagine ourselves doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>ought to be punished, because we perceive by our
own sympathy with it that more of this sort of thing
is likely to take place if it is not put down. We want
the house-breaker to be stigmatized, disgraced, and
imprisoned, because we feel that, if this is not done,
he and others will be encouraged to more housebreaking;
but we feel only pity for the man who
thinks he is Julius Cæsar, because we suppose there
is nothing to be feared either from him or his example.
This practical basis of the distinction expresses
itself in the general, and I think justifiable, reluctance
to apply the name and treatment of insanity to
behavior which seems likely to be imitated. It is
felt that whatever may be the mental state of the
man who commits an act of violence or fraud, it is
wholesome that people in general, who draw no fine
distinctions, but judge others by themselves, should
be taught by example that such conduct is followed
by moral and legal penalties. On the other hand,
when the behavior is so evidently remote from ordinary
habits of thought that it can be a matter only
of pity or curiosity, there is no occasion to do anything
more than the good of the person affected
seems to require.</p>

<p class='c012'>The same analysis applies to the whole question of
responsibility or irresponsibility. It is a matter of
imaginative contact and personal idea. To hold a
man responsible, is to imagine him as a man like
ourselves, having similar impulses but failing to control
them as we do, or at least as we feel we ought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>do. We think of doing as he does, find it wrong,
and impute the wrong to him. The irresponsible
person is one who is looked upon as a different sort
of being, not human with reference to the conduct in
question, not imaginable, not near enough to us to be
the object of hostile sentiment. We <em>blame</em> the former;
that is, we visit him with a sympathetic resentment;
we condemn that part of ourselves that we
find in him. But in the latter we do not find ourselves
at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is worth noting in this connection, that we could
not altogether cease to blame others without ceasing
to blame ourselves, which would mean moral apathy.
It is sometimes thought that the cool analysis of such
questions as this tends toward indifferentism; but I
do not see that this is the case. The social psychologist
finds in moral sentiment a central and momentous
fact of human life, and if perchance he does not
himself feel it very vividly, he should have the candor
to confess himself so much the less a man. Indeed,
if there is such a thing as an indifferentist, in the
sense of one who does not feel any cogency in moral
sentiment, he must be quite unsuited to the pursuit
of social or moral science, because he lacks power
to sympathize with, and so observe, the facts upon
which this sort of science must be based.</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not purpose to give this discussion a practical
turn by entering into the details of the treatment of
various forms of degeneracy; but it may help to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>show the bearing of our general view, if I point out
in brief the line of procedure which common-sense
would seem to call for. This procedure naturally
divides itself into prevention, reform or cure, and
isolation, according to the stage of development
which the evil has reached.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everything which acts in a favorable manner upon
either the hereditary or the social factor in life is
more or less preventive of degeneracy, and of course
influences of this general sort are of far more importance
as a whole than any more particular measures.
Under the head of prevention would also come punishment,
disgrace, and the like—everything in the
treatment of criminals, paupers, and other special
classes which is designed to impress the minds of
the rest of the people, and to check the degenerate
tendencies possibly existing among them. Although
it is now thought that the efficacy of these deterrent
influences, in the case of crime at least, is less than was
formerly supposed, still it is by no means desirable
that the attempt to exert them should be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c012'>If degenerate tendencies actually manifest themselves,
the main thing to be done is to take note of
them as early in the individual’s life as possible, and
to attempt to counteract them by a suitable change
in the social environment. I need hardly point out
that it is now believed that such counteraction is
much more practicable than was formerly supposed,
or mention that many beneficent institutions and
other enterprises exist which aim to secure it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>And if, as must always be the fact in a considerable
proportion of cases, the person remains so distinctly
and persistently below the standard of character
and conduct that it is clearly inexpedient to
leave him at large, the rational treatment of him is
evidently a decent isolation, which shall prevent him
from propagating his degenerate traits through either
heredity or social influence.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c009'>FREEDOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Meaning of Freedom—Freedom and Discipline—Freedom
as a Phase of the Social Order—Freedom Involves Incidental
Strain and Degeneracy.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>Goethe remarks in his Autobiography<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c013'><sup>[107]</sup></a> that the
word freedom has so fair a sound that we cannot
do without it even though it designate an error.
Certainly it is a word inseparable from our higher
sentiments, and if, in its popular use at the present
day, it has no precise meaning, there is so much the
more reason why we should try to give it one, and to
continue its use as a symbol of something that mankind
cherishes and strives for.</p>

<p class='c012'>The common notion of freedom is negative, that is,
it is a notion of the absence of constraint. Starting
with the popular individualistic view of things, the
social order is thought of as something apart from,
and more or less a hinderance to, a man’s natural development.
There is an assumption that an ordinary
person is self-sufficient in most respects, and
will do very well if he is only left alone. But there
is, of course, no such thing as the absence of restraint,
in the sense of social limitations; man has no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>existence apart from a social order, and can develop
his personality only through the social order, and in
the same degree that it is developed. A freedom
consisting in the removal of limiting conditions is
inconceivable. If the word is to have any definite
meaning in sociology, it must therefore be separated
from the idea of a fundamental opposition between
society and the individual, and made to signify something
that is both individual and social. To do this
it is not necessary to do any great violence to accepted
ideas of a practical sort; since it is rather in
theory than in application that the popular view is
objectionable. A sociological interpretation of freedom
should take away nothing worth keeping from
our traditional conception of it, and may add something
in the way of breadth, clearness, and productiveness.</p>

<p class='c012'>The definition of freedom naturally arising from
the chapters that have gone before is perhaps this:
that it is <em>opportunity for right development</em>, for development
in accordance with the progressive ideal of
life that we have in conscience. A child comes into
the world with an outfit of vague tendencies, for all
definite unfolding of which he is dependent upon
social conditions. If cast away alone on a desert
island he would, supposing that he succeeded in living
at all, never attain a real humanity, would never
know speech, or social sentiment, or any complex
thought. On the other hand, if all his surroundings
are from the first such as to favor the enlargement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>and enrichment of his life, he may attain the fullest
development possible to him in the actual state of
the world. In so far as the social conditions have
this favoring action upon him he may be said to be
free. And so every person, at every stage of his
growth, is free or unfree in proportion as he does or
does not find himself in the midst of conditions conducive
to full and harmonious personal development.
Thinking in this way we do not regard the individual
as separable from the social order as a whole, but we
do regard him as capable of occupying any one of
an indefinite number of positions within that order,
some of them more suitable to him than others.</p>

<p class='c012'>No doubt there are elements of vagueness in this
conception. What is full and harmonious personal
development? What is the right, the opportunity
to achieve which is freedom? The possibilities of
development are infinitely various, and unimaginable
until they begin to be realized, so that it would appear
that our notion gives us nothing definite to go
by after all. This is largely true: development cannot
be defined, either for the race or for individuals,
but is and must remain an ideal, of which we can get
only partial and shifting glimpses. In fact, we should
cease to think of freedom as something definite and
final, that can be grasped and held fast once for all,
and learn to regard it as a line of advance, something
progressively appearing out of the invisible and defining
itself, like the forms of a mountain up which
one is climbing in a mist. This vagueness and incompleteness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>are only what we meet in every direction
when we attempt to define our ideals. What is
progress? What is right? What is beauty? What
is truth? The endeavor to produce unmistakable and
final definitions of these things is now, I suppose,
given up, and we have come to recognize that the
good, in all its forms, is evolved rather than achieved,
is a process rather than a state.</p>

<p class='c012'>The best definition of freedom is perhaps nothing
other than the most helpful way of thinking about
it; and it seems to me that the most helpful way of
thinking about it is to regard it in the light of the
contrast between what a man is and what he might
be, as our experience of life enables us to imagine
the two states. Ideas of this sort are suggested by
defining freedom as opportunity, and their tendency
is to stimulate and direct practical endeavor. If the
word helps us to realize, for instance, that it is possible
to make healthy, intelligent, and hopeful children
out of those that are now sickly, dull, and unhappy,
so much the better. On the other hand, the
definition of it as letting people alone, well enough
suited, perhaps, to an over-governed state of society,
does not seem especially pertinent to our time and
country.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have always been taught by philosophy that
the various forms of the good were merely different
views of the same thing, and this idea is certainly
applicable to such notions as those of freedom, progress,
and right. Thus freedom may be regarded as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>merely the individual aspect of progress, the two being
related as the individual and the social order
were asserted to be in the first chapter, and no more
distinct or separable. If instead of contrasting what
a particular man is with what he might be, we do the
same for mankind as a whole, we have the notion of
progress. Progress which does not involve liberation
is evidently no progress at all; and, on the other
hand, a freedom that is not part of the general onward
movement of society is not free in the largest
sense. Again, any practicable idea of freedom must
connect it with some standard of right, in which, like
opposing claims in a clearing-house, the divergent
tendencies of each person, and of different persons,
are disciplined and reconciled. The wrong is the
unfree; it is that which tends, on the whole, to restrict
personal development. It is no contribution
to freedom to turn loose the insane or the criminal,
or to allow children to run on the streets instead of
going to school. The only test of all these things—of
right, freedom, progress, and the like—is the instructed
conscience; just as the only test of beauty
is a trained æsthetic sense, which is a mental conclusion
of much the same sort as conscience.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far as discipline is concerned, freedom means
not its absence but the use of higher and more
rational forms as contrasted with those that are lower
or less rational. A free discipline controls the individual
by appealing to his reason and conscience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>and therefore to his self-respect; while an unfree
control works upon some lower phase of the mind,
and so tends to degrade him. It is freedom to be
disciplined in as rational a manner as you are fit for.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus freedom is relative to the particular persons
and states who are to enjoy it, some individuals
within any society, and some societies as wholes,
being capable of a higher sort of response than
others. In the family, it implies the substitution,
so far as practicable, of familiarity and moral suasion
for distance and the rod; in government the growth of
public opinion and education as compared with autocracy
and the military and police functions; in the
church, the decline of dogma, form, the fear of hell and
hypnotic conversion, relatively to intelligence, sympathy,
and good works. But any relaxation of lower
forms of discipline which is not supplied by higher,
which tends, on the whole, to confusion rather than
reorganization, is not in the way of real freedom.
The question what this is is always one that is
relative to the actual situation, never one that can be
absolutely or abstractly answered. Freedom can be
increased only in connection with the increase of
sympathy, intelligence, and self-control in individuals.</p>

<p class='c011'>The social order is antithetical to freedom only in
so far as it is a bad one. Freedom can exist only in
and through a social order, and must be increased by
all the healthy growth of the latter. It is only in a
large and complex social system that any advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>degree of it is possible, because nothing else can
supply the multifarious opportunities by means of
which all sorts of persons can work out a congenial
development through the choice of influences.</p>

<p class='c012'>In so far as we have freedom in the United States at
the present time, in what does it consist? Evidently,
it seems to me, in the access to a great number and
variety of influences by whose progressive selection
and assimilation a child may become, within vague
limits set by the general state of our society, the best
that he is naturally fitted to become. It consists, to
begin with infancy, in a good family life, in intelligent
nurture and training, adapted to the special
traits of character which every child manifests from
the first week of life. Then it involves good schooling,
admitting the child through books and teachers to a
rich selection from the accumulated influences of the
best minds of the past. Free technical and professional
education, so far as it exists, contributes to it,
also the facility of travel, bringing him in contact
with significant persons from all over the world;
public libraries, magazines, good newspapers, and so
on. Whatever enlarges his field of selection without
permanently confusing him adds to his liberty. In
fact, institutions—government, churches, industries,
and the like—have properly no other function than
to contribute to human freedom; and in so far as they
fail, on the whole, to perform this function, they are
wrong and need reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although a high degree of freedom can exist only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>through a complex social order, it by no means follows
that every complex social order is free. On the
contrary, it has more often been true in the past that
very large and intricately organized states, like the
Roman Empire, were constructed on a comparatively
mechanical or unfree principle. And in our own time
a vast and complex empire, like Russia or China, may
be less free than the simplest English-speaking colony.
There are serious objections to identifying
progress, as Herbert Spencer sometimes appears to
do, with the mere differentiation and co-ordination of
social functions. But the example of the United
States, which is perhaps on the whole the most intricately
differentiated and co-ordinated state that
ever existed, shows that complexity is not inconsistent
with freedom. To enter fully into this matter
would require a more careful examination of the
institutional aspect of life than I wish to undertake
at present; but I hold that the possibility of organizing
large and complex societies on a free principle
depends upon the quickness and facility of communication,
and so has come to exist only in recent times.
The great states of earlier history were necessarily
somewhat mechanical in structure.</p>

<p class='c012'>It happens from time to time in every complex and
active society, that certain persons feel the complexity
and insistence as a tangle, and seek freedom
in retirement, as Thoreau sought it at Walden Pond.
They do not, however, in this manner escape from
the social institutions of their time, nor do they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>really mean to do so; what they gain, if they are successful,
is a saner relation to them. Thoreau in his
hut remained as truly a member of society, as dependent
for suggestion upon his books, his friends,
and his personal memories, and upon verbal expression
for his sense of self, as did Emerson in Concord
or Lowell in Cambridge; and I imagine that if he
had cared to discuss the matter he would have admitted
that this was the case. Indeed, the idea of
Thoreau as a recluse was not, I think, his own idea,
but has been attached to him by superficial observers
of his life. Although he was a dissenter from the
state and the church of his time, his career would
have been impossible without those institutions,
without Harvard College, for instance, which was
a joint product of the two. He worked out his
personal development through congenial influences
selected from the life of his time, very much as others
do. He simply had peculiar tendencies which he
developed in a peculiar way, especially by avoiding
a gregarious mode of life unsuited to his temperament.
He was free through the social order, not
outside of it, and the same may be said of Edward
Fitzgerald and other seclusive spirits. No doubt
the commonplace life of the day is a sort of slavery
for many sensitive minds that have not, like these,
the resolution to escape from it into a calmer and
broader atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since freedom is not a fixed thing that can be
grasped and held once for all, but a growth, any particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>society, such as our own, always appears partly
free and partly unfree. In so far as it favors, in
every child, the development of his highest possibilities,
it is free, but where it falls short of this it is
not. So far as children are ill-nurtured or ill-taught,
as family training is bad, the schools inefficient, the
local government ill-administered, public libraries
lacking, or private associations for various sorts of
culture deficient, in so far the people are unfree. A
child born in a slum, brought up in a demoralized
family, and put at some confining and mentally
deadening work when ten or twelve years old, is no
more free to be healthy, wise, and moral than a Chinese
child is free to read Shakespeare. Every social
ill involves the enslavement of individuals.</p>

<p class='c012'>This idea of freedom is quite in accord with a general,
though vague, sentiment among us; it is an idea
of fair play, of giving everyone a chance; and nothing
arouses more general and active indignation among
our people than the belief that someone or some
class is not getting a fair chance. There seems, however,
to be too great complacency in the way in which
the present state of things is interpreted, a tendency
to assume that freedom has been achieved once for
all by the Declaration of Independence and popular
suffrage, and that little remains but to let each person
realize the general blessing to the best of his ability.
It is well to recognize that the freedom which we
nominally worship is never more than partly achieved,
and is every day threatened by new encroachments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>that the right to vote is only one phase of it, and
possibly, under present conditions, not the most important
phase, and that we can maintain and increase
it only by a sober and determined application of our
best thought and endeavor. Those lines of Lowell’s
“Commemoration Ode” are always applicable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“—the soft Ideal that we wooed</div>
      <div class='line'>Confronts us fiercely, foe-beset, pursued,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cries reproachful: Was it then my praise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not myself was loved? Prove now thy truth.</div>
      <div class='line'>I claim of thee the promise of thy youth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In our view of freedom we have a right to survey
all times and countries and from them form for our
own social order an ideal condition, which shall offer
to each individual all the encouragements to growth
and culture that the world has ever or anywhere enjoyed.
Any narrowness or lack of symmetry in life
in general is reflected in the contraction or warping
of personal development, and so constitutes a lack of
freedom. The social order should not exaggerate one
or a few aspects of human nature at the expense of
others, but extend its invitations to all our higher
tendencies. Thus the excessive preoccupation of the
nineteenth century with material production and
physical science may be regarded as a partial enslavement
of the spiritual and æsthetic sides of humanity,
from which we are now struggling to escape. The
freedom of the future must, it would seem, call more
and more for a various, rich, and tolerant environment,
in which all sorts of persons may build themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>up by selective development. The day for any
sort of dogmatism and coercive uniformity appears to
be past, and it will be practicable to leave people
more and more to control by a conscience reflecting
the moral opinion of the group to which their inclination
and capacity attach them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The substitution of higher forms of control for
lower, the offering more alternatives and trusting the
mind to make a right selection, involves, of course,
an increased moral strain upon individuals. Now
this increase of moral strain is not in all cases exactly
proportioned to the ability to bear it well; and when
it is not well borne the effect upon character is more
or less destructive, so that something in the way of
degeneracy results.</p>

<p class='c012'>Consequently every general increase of freedom is
accompanied by some degeneracy, attributable to the
same causes as the freedom. This is very plainly to
be seen at the present time, which is one, on the
whole, of rapid increase of freedom. Family life
and the condition of women and children have been
growing freer and better, but along with this we
have the increase of divorce and of spoiled children.
Democracy in the state has its own peculiar evils,
as we all know; and in the church the decay of dogmatism
and unreasoning faith, a moral advance on
the whole, has nevertheless caused a good many
moral failures. In much the same way the enfranchisement
of the negroes is believed to have caused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>an increase of insanity among them, and the growth
of suicide in all countries seems to be due in part to
the strain of a more complex society. It is not true,
exactly, that freedom itself causes degeneracy, because
if one is subjected to more strain than is good
for him his real freedom is rather contracted than
enlarged, but it should rather be said that any movement
which has increase of freedom for its general
effect can never be so regulated as to have only this
effect, but is sure to act upon some in an opposite
manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nor is it reasonable to sit back and say that this
incidental demoralization is inevitable, a fixed price
of progress. On the contrary, although it can never
be altogether dispensed with, it can be indefinitely
reduced, and every social institution or influence that
tends to adapt the stress of civilization to the strength
of the individual does reduce it in some measure.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Also free will, determinism, egoism, and altruism, which involve,
in my opinion, a kindred misconception.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. It should easily be understood that one who agrees with what
was said in the preceding chapter about the relation between society
and the individual, can hardly entertain the question whether the
individual will is free or externally determined. This question assumes
as true what he holds to be false, namely that the particular
aspect of mankind is separable from the collective aspect. The
idea underlying it is that of an isolated fragment of life, the will,
on the one hand, and some great mass of life, the environment, on
the other; the question being which of these two antithetical forces
shall be master. If one, then the will is free; if the other, then
it is determined. It is as if each man’s mind were a castle besieged
by an army, and the question were whether the army should
make a breach and capture the occupants. It is hard to see how
this way of conceiving the matter could arise from a direct observation
of actual social relations. Take, for instance, the case of a
member of Congress, or of any other group of reasoning, feeling,
and mutually influencing creatures. Is he free in relation to the
rest of the body or do they control him? The question appears
senseless. He is influenced by them and also exerts an influence
upon them. While he is certainly not apart from their power, he
is controlled, if we use that word, <em>through</em> his own will and not in
spite of it. And it seems plain enough that a relation similar in
kind holds between the individual and the nation, or between the
individual and humanity in general. If you think of human life as
a whole and of each individual as a member and not a fragment,
as, in my opinion, you must if you base your thoughts on a direct
study of society and not upon metaphysical or theological preconceptions,
the question whether the will is free or not is seen to be
meaningless. The individual will appears to be a specialized part
of the general life, more or less divergent from other parts and
possibly contending with them; but this very divergence is a part
of its function—just as a member of Congress serves that body by
urging his particular opinions—and in a large view does not separate
but unites it to life as a whole. It is often necessary to consider
the individual with reference to his opposition to other
persons, or to prevailing tendencies, and in so doing it may be
convenient to speak of him as separate from and antithetical to the
life about him: but this separateness and opposition are incidental,
like the right hand pulling against the left to break a string, and
there seems to be no sufficient warrant for extending it into a general
or philosophical proposition.</p>

<p class='c012'>There may be some sense in which the question of the freedom
of the will is still of interest; but it seems to me that the student
of social relations may well pass it by as one of those scholastic
controversies which are settled, if at all, not by being decided one
way or the other, but by becoming obsolete.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. The imitativeness of children is stimulated by the imitativeness
of parents. A baby cannot hit upon any sort of a noise, but the
admiring family, eager for communication, will imitate it again and
again, hoping to get a repetition. They are usually disappointed,
but the exercise probably causes the child to notice the likeness of
the sounds and so prepares the way for imitation. It is perhaps
safe to say that up to the end of the first year the parents are more
imitative than the child.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. “In like manner any act or expression is a stimulus to the nerve-centres
that perceive or understand it. Unless their action is inhibited
by the will, or by counter-stimulation, they must discharge
themselves in movements that more or less closely copy the originals.”—Giddings,
Principles of Sociology, 110.</p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Goethe, in various places, contrasts modern art and literature
with those of the Greeks in respect to the fact that the former
express individual characteristics, the latter those of a race and an
epoch. Thus in a letter to Schiller—No. 631 of the Goethe-Schiller
correspondence—he says of Paradise Lost, “In the case of this
poem, as with all modern works of art, it is in reality the individual
that manifests itself that awakens the interest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Can there be some illusion mixed with the truth of this idea? Is
it not the case that the nearer a thing is to our habit of thought the
more clearly we see the individual, and the more vaguely, if at all,
the universal? And would not an ancient Greek, perhaps, have
seen as much of what was peculiar to each artist, and as little of
what was common to all, as we do in a writer of our own time?
The principle is much the same as that which makes all Chinamen
look pretty much alike to us: we see the type because it is so
different from what we are used to, but only one who lives within
it can fully perceive the differences among individuals.</p>

One regards it as the distinctive or characteristic in expression,

according to the other, style is mastery over the common medium
of expression, as language or the technique of painting or
sculpture. These are not so inconsistent as they seem. Good style is
both; that is, a significant personality expressed in a workmanlike
manner.</p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. With me, at least, this is the case. Some whom I have consulted
find that certain sentiments—for instance, pity—may be
directly suggested by the word, without the mediation of a personal
symbol. This hardly affects the argument, as it will not be doubted
that the sentiment was in its inception associated with a personal
symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. This idea that social persons are not mutually exclusive but
composed largely of common elements is implied in Professor William
James’s doctrine of the Social Self and set forth at more length
in Professor James Mark Baldwin’s Social and Ethical Interpretations
of Mental Development. Like other students of social psychology
I have received much instruction and even more helpful
provocation from the latter brilliant and original work. To Professor
James my obligation is perhaps greater still.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. I distinguish, of course, between egotism, which is an English
word of long standing, and egoism, which was, I believe, somewhat
recently introduced by moralists to designate, in antithesis to altruism,
certain theories or facts of ethics. I do not object to these
words as names of theories, but as purporting to be names of facts
of conduct I do, and have in mind more particularly their use by
Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Psychology and other works.
As used by Spencer they seem to me valid from a physiological
standpoint only, and fallacious when employed to describe mental,
social, or moral facts. The trouble is, as with his whole system,
that the physiological aspect of life is expounded and assumed, apparently,
to be the only aspect that science can consider. Having
ventured to find fault with Spencer, I may be allowed to add that I
have perhaps learned as much from him as from any other writer.
If only his system did not appear at first quite so complete and final
one might more easily remain loyal to it in spite of its deficiencies.
But when these latter begin to appear its very completeness makes
it seem a sort of a prison-wall which one must break down to get
out.</p>

<p class='c012'>I shall try to show the nature of egotism and selfishness in Chapter
VI.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. Some may question whether we can pity ourselves in this way.
But it seems to me that we avoid self-pity only by not vividly imagining
ourselves in a piteous plight; and that if we do so imagine
ourselves the sentiment follows quite naturally.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. Sympathy in the sense of compassion is a specific emotion or
sentiment, and has nothing necessarily in common with sympathy
in the sense of communion. It might be thought, perhaps, that
compassion was one form of the sharing of feeling; but this appears
not to be the case. The sharing of painful feeling may precede
and cause compassion, but is not the same with it. When I
feel sorry for a man in disgrace, it is, no doubt, in most cases,
because I have imaginatively partaken of his humiliation; but my
compassion for him is not the thing that is shared, but is something
additional, a comment on the shared feeling. I may imagine how
a suffering man feels—sympathize with him in that sense—and be
moved not to pity but to disgust, contempt, or perhaps admiration.
Our feeling makes all sorts of comments on the imagined feeling
of others. Moreover it is not essential that there should be any
real understanding in order that compassion may be felt. One may
compassionate a worm squirming on a hook, or a fish, or even a
tree. As between persons pity, while often a helpful and healing
emotion, leading to kindly acts, is sometimes indicative of the absence
of true sympathy. We all wish to be understood, at least in
what we regard as our better aspects, but few of us wish to be
pitied except in moments of weakness and discouragement. To
accept pity is to confess that one falls below the healthy standard of
vigor and self-help. While a real understanding of our deeper
thought is rare and precious, pity is usually cheap, many people
finding an easy pleasure in indulging it, as one may in the indulgence
of grief, resentment, or almost any emotion. It is often felt
by the person who is its object as a sort of an insult, a back-handed
thrust at self-respect, the unkindest cut of all. For instance, as
between richer and poorer classes in a free country a mutually
respecting antagonism is much healthier than pity on the one hand
and dependence on the other, and is, perhaps, the next best thing
to fraternal feeling.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. Much of what is ordinarily said in this connection indicates a
confusion of the two ideas of specialization and isolation. These
are not only different but, in what they imply, quite opposite and
inconsistent. Speciality implies a whole to which the special part
has a peculiar relation, while isolation implies that there is no
whole.</p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#r76'>76</a>. In reading studies of a particular aspect of life, like M. Tarde’s
brilliant work, Les Lois de l’Imitation, it is well to remember that
there are many such aspects, any of which, if expounded at length
and in an interesting manner, might appear for the time to be of
more importance than any other. I think that other phases of
social activity, such, for instance, as communication, competition,
differentiation, adaptation, idealization, have as good claims as
imitation to be regarded as the social process, and that a book
similar in character to M. Tarde’s might, perhaps, be written upon
any one of them. The truth is that the real process is a multiform
thing of which these are glimpses. They are good so long as we
recognize that they <em>are</em> glimpses and use them to help out our perception
of that many-sided whole which life is; but if they become
<em>doctrines</em> they are objectionable.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Struggle for Existence is another of these glimpses of life
which just now seems to many the dominating fact of the universe,
chiefly because attention has been fixed upon it by copious and interesting
exposition. As it has had many predecessors in this place
of importance, so doubtless it will have many successors.</p>
